    "# Text Embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "AI models cannot directly process raw text; they must convert it into a numerical format. This process involves **tokenization** and **embedding**.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "The text is first broken down into smaller units called **tokens** (words, sub-words, or characters) by a **tokenizer**. Each token is then assigned a unique **numerical ID** from the model's vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "These numerical IDs are passed to an **embedding model**, which generates a **vector** of floating-point numbers for each token. This vector is the **embedding**, and it captures the **semantic meaning** of the token. Tokens with similar meanings are positioned closer together in the high-dimensional embedding space.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Factual Corrections and Key Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Model Specificity:** Every model's embedding is unique, defined by its specific **training data and architecture**. Therefore, two different models will generate different embeddings for the exact same token.\n",
    "* **Dimensionality:** The **dimension** (length) of the embedding vector is a fixed architectural parameter. It determines the **capacity** for the vector to store semantic information, but the specific **semantic information** is encoded by the values within the vector, which are learned during training.\n",
    "* **Types:** Embeddings are a general concept used across different data types, including **text**, **image/video**, and **audio**. \n",
    "\n",

          "PART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nOverview\nUber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a technology platform that uses a massive network,\nleading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. We develop and operate\nproprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform (“platform(s)” or “Platform(s)”). We connect\nconsumers (“Rider(s)”) with independent providers of ride services (“Mobility Driver(s)”) for ridesharing services, and connect Riders\nand other consumers (“Eater(s)”) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, “Merchants”) with delivery service providers\n(“Couriers”) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as “end-user(s)”\nor “consumer(s).” Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as “Driver(s).” We also connect consumers with public\ntransportation networks. We use this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers\n(“Shipper(s)”) with carriers (“Carrier(s)”) in the freight industry by providing Carriers with the ability to book a shipment,\ntransportation management and other logistics services. Uber is also developing technologies designed to provide new solutions to\nsolve everyday problems.\nOur technology is available in over 70 countries around the world, principally in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada, Latin\nAmerica, Europe (excluding Russia), the Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific (“APAC”, excluding China and Southeast Asia).\nOur Segments\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had three operating and reportable segments: Mobility, Delivery and Freight. Mobility, Delivery\nand Freight platform offerings each address large, fragmented markets.\nMobility\nOur Mobility offering connects consumers with a wide range of transportation modalities, such as ridesharing, carsharing,\nmicromobility, rentals, public transit, taxis, and more—helping customers go almost anywhere they need. We believe our global\nleadership position—and the vast amount of marketplace data that comes along with it—means that we have the best technical and\ndata platform to innovate faster than other companies with similar products.\nWe believe our scale and global availability allows our Mobility segment to offer better consumer experiences to riders in a\nvariety of vehicle types, providing consumers with higher reliability and Drivers with better earnings opportunities. Mobility also\nincludes activity related to our financial partnerships products and advertising.\nDelivery\nOur Delivery offering allows consumers to search for and discover the best of local commerce—from restaurants to grocery,\nalcohol, convenience and other retailers—order a meal or other items, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have it delivered. We\nrefer to the grocery, alcohol, convenience, and retail categories collectively as Grocery & Retail. After launching our Delivery app,\nUber Eats, over nine years ago, we believe our Delivery offering increases consumer engagement with the Uber platform overall,\nwhich in turn results in broader reach for our Merchants who can attract Uber Eats consumers from Uber without increasing their own\ncosts. For Drivers, we believe the Delivery offering leverages, and has expanded, our earner base by increasing utilization and\nearnings across the network. We also believe it attracts new Drivers to the platform who do not have access to Mobility-qualified\nvehicles. Over the last several years, our Delivery business has expanded to include Uber Direct, our white-label Delivery-as-a-\nService offering to retailers and restaurants around the world, as well as advertising opportunities.\nFreight\nWe believe that Freight is revolutionizing the logistics industry. Freight powers a managed transportation and logistics network\nand connects Shippers and Carriers in a digital marketplace to move shipments while leveraging our proprietary technology, brand\nawareness, and experience revolutionizing industries. Freight provides an on-demand platform to automate and accelerate logistics\ntransactions end-to-end while providing visibility and control of logistics networks. Freight connects Carriers with Shippers’\nshipments available on our platform, and gives Carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment with the touch\nof a button. Freight serves Shippers ranging from small- and medium-sized businesses to global enterprises. By leveraging logistics\nsolutions expertise and value-add solutions, Freight enables Shippers to create and tender shipments, secure capacity on demand with\nreal-time pricing, and track those shipments from pickup to delivery. Freight operations are principally based in North America and\nEurope. We believe that all of these factors represent significant efficiency improvements over traditional transportation management\nand freight brokerage providers.\n4",
          "Platform Synergies\nOur Platform\nThe foundation of our platform is our massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise.\nTogether, these elements power movement from point A to point B.\nMassive Network Our massive, efficient, and intelligent network consists of tens of millions of Drivers, consumers,\nMerchants, Shippers and Carriers, as well as underlying data, technology, and shared infrastructure.\nOur network becomes smarter with every trip. In more than 15,000 cities around the world (as of\nDecember 31, 2024), our network powers movement at the touch of a button for millions, and we hope\neventually billions, of people.\nLeading Technology We have built proprietary marketplace, routing, and payments technologies. Marketplace technologies\nare the core of our deep technology advantage and include demand prediction, matching and\ndispatching, and pricing technologies. Our technologies make it extremely efficient to launch new\nbusinesses and operationalize existing ones.\nOperational Excellence Our regional on-the-ground operations teams use their extensive market-specific knowledge to rapidly\nlaunch and scale products in cities, support Drivers, consumers, Merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, and\nbuild and enhance relationships with cities and regulators.\nProduct Expertise Our products are built with the expertise that allows us to set the standard for powering movement on-\ndemand, provide platform users with a contextual, intuitive interface, continually evolve features and\nfunctionality, and deliver safety and trust.\nWe intend to continue to invest in new platform offerings that we believe will further strengthen our platform and existing\nofferings.\nWe believe that all of these synergies serve the customer experience, enabling us to attract new platform users and to deepen\nengagement with existing platform users. Both of these dynamics grow our network scale and liquidity, which further increases the\nvalue of our platform-to-platform users. For example, Delivery attracts new consumers to our network—for the three months ended\nDecember 31, 2024, approximately 61% of first-time Delivery consumers were new to our platform. Additionally, for the three months\nended December 31, 2024, consumers who used both Mobility and Delivery generated 11.4 Trips per month on average, compared to\n5.2 Trips per month on average for consumers who used a single offering in cities where both Mobility and Delivery were offered. We\nbelieve that these trends will improve as we further leverage the power of our platform.\nMembership\nWith our platform, we are making it even easier for our consumers to unlock convenience—Uber One is our single cross-platform\nmembership program that brings together the best of Uber. Uber One members have access to discounts, special pricing, priority\nservice, and exclusive perks across our rides, delivery and grocery and retail offerings. Uber One is available in over 30 countries. Our\nEats Pass membership program continues to remain available in select cities as a subscription offering. Our membership programs are\ndesigned to make utilizing our suite of products a seamless and rewarding experience for our consumers. As of December 31, 2024,\nUber One member base reached 30 million.\nAdvertising\nWe are also utilizing our data and scale to offer marketplace-centric advertising to connect merchants and brands with our\nplatform network and unlocking cross-platform advertising formats. During October 2022, we officially launched Uber’s advertising\ndivision and introduced Uber Journey Ads, an engaging way for brands to connect with consumers throughout the entire ride process.\nWe now offer a model that enables brands to partner with Uber on a variety of advertising options on the Uber and Uber Eats apps,\nand beyond, while connecting with consumers in brand-safe and captivating ways. We also provide comprehensive reporting and\nanalysis, which helps brands fine-tune their understanding of consumers and create more impactful campaigns as they connect with\nconsumers at relevant points throughout their journeys and transactions. We believe that our advertising further strengthens the power\nof our platform and will continue to do so as we onboard more advertisers.\nCompetitive Environment\nWe compete on a global basis in highly fragmented markets. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery\nindustries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost\nalternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers to entry that characterize\nthese industries. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to\nbecome subject to additional competition. While we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range\nof industries, many of our competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing\nthem to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do. The competition we face in each of\nour offerings includes:\n5",
          "• Mobility. Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of\npassenger miles in the markets that we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-\nhailing services, livery and other car services. In addition, public transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility\noffering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in many cities. We also compete with other\nridesharing companies for Drivers and Riders, including Bolt, Didi, Grab, Lyft, and Ola.\n• Delivery. Our Delivery offering competes with numerous companies in the meal, grocery and other delivery space in various\nregions for drivers, consumers, and merchants, including DoorDash, Deliveroo, Glovo, Instacart, Gopuff, Rappi, iFood,\nDelivery Hero, Just Eat Takeaway, and Amazon. Our Delivery offering also competes with restaurants and other merchants,\nincluding those that offer their own delivery and/or take-away, meal kit delivery services, grocery delivery services, and\ntraditional grocers.\n• Freight. Our Freight offering competes with global and North American freight brokers and managed transportation providers\nsuch as C.H. Robinson, Total Quality Logistics, RXO, XPO, Echo Global Logistics, DHL, and NEXT Trucking.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe operate in a particularly complex legal and regulatory environment. Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state,\nlocal and foreign laws, rules, and regulations, including those related to Internet activities, privacy, cybersecurity, data protection,\nintellectual property, competition, consumer protection, payments, labor and employment, transportation services, transportation\nnetwork companies, licensing regulations and taxation. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted,\napplied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business. Examples of certain laws and regulations we are subject to are\ndescribed below. For further discussion of risks relating to government regulation, see our risk factors, including the risk factors in the\nsection titled “Legal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur platform, and in particular our Mobility products, are subject to differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws, rules, and\nregulations in the numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. A large number of proposals are before various national, regional, and\nlocal legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to\nour business model.\nIn the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restrictions and other requirements on\noperating our Mobility products, including licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements. Outside of the United\nStates, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules, and regulations while other jurisdictions have not adopted any laws,\nrules, and regulations which govern our Mobility business. Further, certain jurisdictions, including Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan,\nSouth Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, and regulations banning\ncertain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment\ncreates significant complexities for our business and operating model. In addition, our Delivery and Freight products are also subject\nto laws, regulations and standards that govern the transportation of food, alcohol and other goods.\nSubstantially all states in the United States and numerous municipalities in the United States and around the world have adopted\nTransportation Network Company (“TNC”) regulations. These regulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or\nmobile apps that connect individual drivers with their own vehicles to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their\ndestinations. These regulations often require TNCs to comply with rules regarding, among other things, background checks, vehicle\ninspections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters.\nIn addition, many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that apply to how we classify the Drivers who use our platform. This\nuncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates significant complexities for our business and operating model. As we\ncontinue to expand our offerings, we may be subject to additional regulations separate from those that apply to our existing products.\nSee the section titled “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A and “Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated\nfinancial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nData Privacy and Protection\nOur technology platform, and the user data we collect and process to run our business, are an integral part of our business model\nand, as a result, our compliance with laws dealing with the collection and processing of personal data is core to our strategy to\nimprove platform user experience and build trust. Regulators around the world have adopted or proposed requirements regarding the\ncollection, use, transfer, security, storage, destruction, and other processing of personal data, and these laws are increasing in number,\nenforcement, fines, and other penalties. Two examples of such regulations that have significant implications for our business are the\nEuropean Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), a law which went into effect in May 2018 and implemented\nmore stringent requirements for processing personal data relating to individuals in the EU, and the California Consumer Privacy Act\n(the “CCPA”), which went into effect in January 2020 and established new consumer rights and data privacy and protection\nrequirements for covered businesses. U.S. state, city, federal, and foreign regulators are expected to continue proposing and adopting\nsignificant laws impacting the processing of personal data and other data relating to individuals, such as the California Privacy Rights\nAct (“CPRA”) passed in California (effective in January 2023), and India’s Digital Personal Data Protection Act enacted in 2023.\n6",
          "Payments and Financial Services\nMost jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. For example, our\nsubsidiary in the Netherlands, Uber Payments B.V., is registered and authorized as an electronic money institution in support of certain\npayment activities in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). We hold similar licenses in the United Kingdom and Mexico.\nRegulators in certain additional jurisdictions may determine that certain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could\nrequire us to obtain licenses to continue to operate in such jurisdictions. In addition, laws related to money transmission and online\npayments are evolving, and changes in such laws could affect our ability to provide payment processing on our platform or to offer or\npromote certain financial services to users of the platform. We are continuing to evaluate our options for seeking further licenses and\napprovals in several other jurisdictions to optimize payment solutions and support future growth of our business.\nAntitrust\nCompetition authorities closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of\ngovernments are enforcing competition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as\nthe EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularly surrounding issues of pricing parity, price-fixing, and abuse of market power.\nIn addition, governmental agencies and regulators may, among other things, prohibit future acquisitions, divestitures, or combinations\nwe plan to make, impose significant fines or penalties, require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other restrictions that limit\nor require us to modify our operations, including limitations on our contractual relationships with platform users or restrictions on our\npricing models.\nIntellectual Property\nWe believe that our intellectual property is essential to our business and affords us a competitive advantage in the markets in\nwhich we operate. Our intellectual property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, social\nmedia accounts/handles, software code, firmware, hardware and hardware designs, registered and unregistered trademarks, trademark\napplications, copyrights, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable), patents, and patent applications.\nTo protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual\nprovisions, end-user policies, and disclosure restrictions. Upon discovery of potential infringement of our intellectual property, we\nassess and when necessary, take action to protect our rights as appropriate. We also enter into confidentiality agreements and invention\nassignment agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary\ninformation in a commercially prudent manner.\nResearch and Development\nBecause the industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological advances, our ability to compete\nsuccessfully depends heavily upon our ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive new offerings and technologies. We\ncontinue to develop new technologies to enhance existing offerings and services, and to expand the range of our offerings through\nresearch and development (“R&D”) and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.\nSeasonality\nMobility\nWe typically expect to experience seasonal impacts to our operating results as we generate higher Gross Bookings in our fourth\nquarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth-quarter holiday and business demand, and typically generate lower Gross\nBookings in our first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform as holiday demand slows down. We\nhave typically experienced softer quarter-over-quarter Mobility trends in the first quarter.\nDelivery\nWe typically expect to experience seasonal impacts to our operating results with increases in our Gross Bookings in the fourth\nquarter compared to other quarters.\nHuman Capital at Uber\nEmployees\nWe are a global company and as of December 31, 2024, we and our subsidiaries had approximately 31,100 employees globally\nand operations in over 70 countries and more than 15,000 cities around the world. Our human capital strategies are developed and\nmanaged by our Chief People Officer, who reports to the CEO, and are overseen by the Compensation Committee and the Board of\nDirectors.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other\npersonnel who are in high demand, are often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our\ncompetitors.\n7",
          "Employee Engagement. To attract and retain the best talent, we strive to establish a culture where people are able to achieve their\nhighest capability. We measure how successful we have been in establishing the culture we need through employee engagement\nsurveys and related tools. We conduct continuous listening by collecting feedback from employees throughout the year and through\nvarious channels. We use the results of these regular checks to better understand employees’ needs and support their teams on topics\nsuch as well-being, fairness, rewards and recognition, and growth opportunities. For example, our hybrid work approach was shaped\nbased on employee feedback. In addition to the engagement survey results, we also monitor the health of our workforce and the\nsuccess of our people operations through monitoring metrics such as attrition, retention, and offer acceptance rates.\nEmployee Development and Retention. We believe that employees who have opportunities for development are more engaged,\nsatisfied, and productive. Employees are empowered to drive their own growth, whether by learning on the job, finding stretch\nassignments, participating in mentorship, or identifying their next opportunity within Uber through internal mobility programs.\nEmployees have access to an internal jobs marketplace for full-time jobs as well as short-term stretch assignments that enable them to\nhave an impact on other areas of the business. Our goal is to help our employees be their best selves by providing programs and\nresources that promote wellness and productivity. Globally, Uber offers competitive benefits packages to our employees and their\nfamilies.\nFor additional discussion, see the risk factor titled “—Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel,\nand continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business.” included in Part I,\nItem 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDriver and Courier Well-Being\nIn addition to employees discussed above, our business also depends on our ability to attract and engage Drivers, consumers,\nMerchants, Shippers, and Couriers, as well as contractors and consultants that support our global operations.\nIn relation to those individuals who earn income on our platform, Uber is one of the largest open platforms for work in the world,\nproviding accessible, flexible work in over 70 countries. Drivers are key parts of the marketplaces that Uber has created through its\napps. People choose to use our platform to earn income without having to apply for, or work the fixed schedules associated with,\ntraditional employment. We believe this flexibility is an improvement over traditional work schedules and is something we believe can\nand should remain available to anyone who chooses platform-based work. Uber monitors regional and global driver attraction,\nretention and satisfaction rates.\nAccessible, flexible, independent work has offered an option for many workers historically marginalized from the labor market\nand has enabled wide geographic coverage and reliable service offerings for consumers. However, it is increasingly clear that more\ncan be done to improve the experience of using an app to connect with work opportunities. Although the situation varies across\ncountries and cities, the benefits and protections for independent workers are generally patchy compared with those that employees\nreceive. The current binary system of employment classification under some legal frameworks means that a worker is either an\nemployee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few. This does not have to\nbe the case. At Uber, we believe that being your own boss should not have to come at the expense of security and dignity in work.\nAround the world, Uber has found innovative ways to address these issues.\n• Advocacy: We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent\nworkers. We believe all work should be treated equally. We also believe that legislative reform is needed to modernize the\nsocial safety net. This includes requiring Uber—and other app based companies—to provide benefits and protections to their\nusers without compromising the flexibility of their use of the app. Some examples of our advocacy to preserve flexibility of\nwork while expanding access to benefits and protections are as follows:\n◦ In Washington State, we partnered with industry and labor to support a bill regulating rideshare, including minimum\nearnings, sick leave, paid family and medical leave, and workers’ compensation coverage for drivers.\n◦ In New York and Massachusetts, we reached agreements with the Attorneys General that introduce new protections\nfor rideshare drivers in these states, including minimum earnings and various benefits.\n◦ In France, we reached a number of sectoral bargaining agreements with elected workers’ representatives to\nimplement new standards related to minimum guaranteed revenues for couriers, minimum fare per trip for drivers,\nand deactivation transparency and appeals process for both.\n• Protections and benefits: We partner with leading insurance companies around the world to pioneer protections for\nindependent workers.\n• Earnings: We are continually developing new technology that Drivers can use to acquire information that may help them\nsave on costs and make informed choices about where and when to drive (based on when and where their earnings potential\nis highest).\n• Learning and Growth: We have partnered with learning and academic institutions to provide opportunities to eligible\nDrivers and/or their family members through undergraduate degree programs and courses on entrepreneurship, skills\n8",

For example, since its launch in 2018, our partnership with Arizona State University has\nenrolled nearly 15,000 Drivers and their family members in English language learning and entrepreneurship courses.\n• Engagement: We are focused on listening to and responding to the ideas and concerns of Drivers and Merchants who use our\nplatform. We believe that the best ideas can come from anywhere, both inside and outside our company. In locations around\nthe world, we are piloting innovative ways for Drivers to participate in meaningful dialogue with us. In markets across the\nworld, we hold regular meetings with Driver associations and conduct regular surveys to gather feedback on our app, our\nsupport services, and other matters.\nFor additional discussion, see the risk factor titled “—If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers,\nmerchants, Shippers, and Carriers, whether as a result of competition or other factors, our platform will become less appealing to\nplatform users.” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAdditional Information\nWe were founded in 2009 and incorporated as Ubercab, Inc., a Delaware corporation, in July 2010.

RISK FACTORS\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should\ncarefully consider the following risks, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nincluding the sections titled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations” and our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results,\nor prospects and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, which would cause you to lose all or part of your\ninvestment. Our business, financial condition, operating results, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not\ncurrently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material.\nRisk Factor Summary\nThe following are some of these risks, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition, operating\nresults, or prospects.\n• Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees instead of\nindependent contractors.\n• The mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that\nhave been available for decades, low barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every\nmajor geographic region.\n• To remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and\nwe have in the past offered, and may continue to offer, significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions.\n• We have incurred significant losses, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating\nexpenses to increase in the foreseeable future, and we may not maintain profitability.\n• If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, whether as a\nresult of competition or other factors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users.\n• Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or\nunsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business.\n9",
          "• Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We receive significant media\ncoverage, including negative publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to\nrehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintain and enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to\nsuffer.\n• We may fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform, fail to offer such technologies on our platform before\nour competitors, or such technologies may fail to perform as expected, may be inferior to those offered by our competitors, or\nmay be perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-autonomous vehicles.\n• If we are unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth, our financial performance and\nfuture prospects will be adversely affected.\n• Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges and\nour efforts to address these challenges may not be successful.\n• Platform users may engage in, or be subject to, criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major\nsafety incidents, which may harm our ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers.\n• We are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future.\nThese new ventures are inherently risky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them.\n• We generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas, and these operations may\nbe negatively affected by economic, social, weather, and regulatory conditions, public health concerns or other\ncircumstances.\n• We have experienced and may experience security or privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to,\nacquisition of, use of, disclosure of, alteration of or destruction of our proprietary or confidential data, employee data, or\nplatform user data.\n• Cyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, denial of service attacks, account takeovers, spamming,\nphishing, and social engineering attacks could harm our reputation, business, and operating results.\n• Our growing use of artificial intelligence and machine learning may present additional risks, including risks associated with\nalgorithm development or use, the tools and data sets used, and/or a complex, developing regulatory environment.\n• We are subject to climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks,\nour business may be adversely impacted.\n• Increased attention to, and evolving expectations regarding sustainability matters may adversely impact our business,\nreputation and liabilities, including in the context of certain goals we have announced.\n• Occurrence of a catastrophic event, including but not limited to disease, a weather event, war, or terrorist attack, could\nadversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operation.\n• We rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in\ncertain of our products and offerings. If such third parties interfere with the distribution of our products or offerings or with\nour use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.\n• We will require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on reasonable\nterms or at all.\n• If we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could\nbe harmed, and any businesses we acquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated.\n• We may continue to be blocked from or limited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions,\nand may be required to modify our business model in those jurisdictions as a result.\n• Our business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future\nprospects.\n• Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial\nservices.\n• We face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which have resulted and may\nresult in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and\ndata protection practices.\n• If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating\nthe intellectual property of others, we may incur significant expense and our business may be adversely affected.\n10",
          "• The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile or may decline steeply or suddenly\nregardless of our operating performance, and we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations. You may not be\nable to resell your shares at or above the price you paid and may lose all or part of your investment.\nOperational and Economic Risks Related to Our Business\nOperational Risks\nOur business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees.\nThe classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United\nStates and abroad. We are involved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action\nlawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before administrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social\nsecurity, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as workers or quasi-employees where those\nstatuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. We believe that Drivers are independent contractors because, among other\nthings, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors’\nplatforms, and provide a vehicle to perform services on our platform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the\nclassification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions. Furthermore, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolving pending\nand future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classification of Drivers have been and may continue to be\nmaterial to our business.\nIn addition, more than 150,000 Drivers in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or\nexpressed an intention to file) arbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the\nclassification claims of a majority of these Drivers under individual settlement agreements. Furthermore, we are involved in numerous\nlegal proceedings regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements entered into with Drivers. If we are not successful in such\nproceedings, this could negatively impact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an\nadverse consequence on our business and financial condition.\nChanges to foreign, state, and local laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial decisions\nregarding independent contractor classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees\nwhere those statuses exist) and/or representation of Drivers by labor unions. For example, California’s Assembly Bill 5 became\neffective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs have brought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5\nrequires Drivers in California to be classified as employees.\nIn November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for\ndrivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that\nDrivers will be able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be\nrequired to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General’s\npreliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods\nbefore the effective date of Proposition 22. The California Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Proposition 22; however,\nlegal challenges, including constitutional challenges, to Proposition 22 may continue to be filed.\nWe face similar challenges in other jurisdictions within the United States and abroad. For example, in July 2020, the\nMassachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an\ninjunction. That case was resolved in June 2024 with the understanding that drivers would continue to be classified as independent\ncontractors. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, we may be required to treat\nDrivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicial\ndecisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers,\nincluding expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest\nperiod requirements), employee benefits, social security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case,\nwe anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additional costs; however, we believe that the financial impact to\nUber would be moderated by the likelihood of other industry participants being similarly affected. Additionally, we may not have\nadequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may\nnot be able to hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to\nfundamentally change our business model, and consequently have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial\nposition and cash flows.\nOther examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that a driver for a third-party meal delivery\nservice was under a “subordinate relationship” of the service, indicating an employment relationship, a decision by the French\nSupreme Court that reclassified an UberX Driver as an employee (which has been followed by inconsistent appellate decisions\nregarding employee status), decisions by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that Drivers should be classified as employees for\nSwiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recent Spanish regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes employment status\nand a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers are employees within the meaning of the taxi collective\nbargaining agreement. As another example, in December 2024, the Mexican Congress passed a bill to amend Mexico’s Federal Labor\n11",
          "Law and reclassify all mobility and delivery earners who make more than one minimum salary a month as employees, with traditional\nlabor law rights, including sharing into the profits of the company.\nIn addition, reclassification of Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, have and could lead\nto groups of Drivers becoming represented by labor unions and similar organizations. For example, in May 2021, we formally\nrecognized a UK driver union and in 2024, voters in Massachusetts approved a ballot initiative allowing drivers to collectively bargain\nas independent contractors. If a significant number of Drivers were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms\nwere to deviate significantly from our business model, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be\nmaterially adversely affected. In addition, a labor dispute involving Drivers may harm our reputation, disrupt our operations and\nreduce our net revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs.\nIn addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees, this may impact our current\nfinancial statement presentation including revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant\nand critical accounting policies in the section titled “Critical Accounting Estimates” included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report\non Form 10-K and Note 1 in the section titled “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part II, Item 8 of this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nThe mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been\navailable for decades, low barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic\nregion. If we are unable to compete effectively in these industries, our business and financial prospects would be adversely\nimpacted.\nOur platform provides offerings in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries. We compete on a global basis, and the markets\nin which we compete are highly fragmented. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally\nand in the logistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the\nfuture we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers to entry that characterize these industries. In\naddition, within each of these markets, the cost to switch between products is low. Consumers have a propensity to shift to the lowest-\ncost or highest-quality provider; Drivers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the highest earnings potential; restaurants and\nother merchants have a propensity to shift to the delivery platform that offers the lowest service fee for their meals and other goods\nand provides the highest volume of orders; and Shippers and Carriers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the best price and\nmost convenient service for hauling shipments.\nFurther, while we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our\ncompetitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized\nexpertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do. As we and our competitors introduce new products and\nofferings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. In addition, our competitors may\nadopt certain of our product features, or may adopt innovations that Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers value more\nhighly than ours, which would render our products less attractive or reduce our ability to differentiate our products. Increased\ncompetition could result in, among other things, a reduction of the revenue we generate from the use of our platform, the number of\nplatform users, the frequency of use of our platform, and our margins.\nWe face competition in each of our offerings, including:\n• Mobility. Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of\npassenger miles in the markets that we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and\ntaxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. In addition, public transportation can be a superior substitute to our\nMobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in many cities. We also compete with\nother ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned entities, for Drivers and riders, including Bolt, Didi,\nGrab, Lyft, and Ola.\n• Delivery. Our Delivery offering competes with numerous companies in the meal, grocery and other delivery space in\nvarious regions for Drivers, consumers, and merchants, including DoorDash, Deliveroo, Glovo, Instacart, Gopuff, Rappi,\niFood, Delivery Hero, Just Eat Takeaway, and Amazon. Our Delivery offering also competes with restaurants and other\nmerchants, including those that offer their own delivery and/or take-away, meal kit delivery services, grocery delivery\nservices, and traditional grocers.\n• Freight. Our Freight offering competes with global and North American freight brokers and managed transportation\nproviders such as C.H. Robinson, Total Quality Logistics, RXO, XPO, Echo Global Logistics, DHL, and NEXT Trucking.\nMany of our competitors are well-capitalized and offer discounted services, Driver incentives, consumer discounts and\npromotions, innovative products and offerings, and alternative pricing models, which may be more attractive to consumers than those\nthat we offer. Further, some of our current or potential competitors have, and may in the future continue to have, greater resources and\naccess to larger Driver, consumer, merchant, Shipper, or Carrier bases in a particular geographic market. In addition, our competitors\nin certain geographic markets enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as greater brand recognition, longer operating histories,\nlarger marketing budgets, better localized knowledge, and more supportive regulatory regimes. As a result, such competitors may be\n12",
          "able to respond more quickly and effectively than us in such markets to new or changing opportunities, technologies, consumer\npreferences, regulations, or standards, which may render our products or offerings less attractive. In addition, future competitors may\nshare in the effective benefit of any regulatory or governmental approvals and litigation victories we may achieve, without having to\nincur the costs we have incurred to obtain such benefits.\nAs a result of certain divestitures, we are contractually restricted from competing with our current or former minority-owned\nentities with respect to certain aspects of our business, including in Southeast Asia through one year after we dispose of all interests in\nGrab, and the Middle East, North Africa and Pakistan through two years after we dispose of all interests in Careem Technologies,\nwhile our minority-owned entities are not necessarily restricted from competing with us anywhere in the world. In addition, we are\ncontractually restricted from competing with some of our majority-owned entities with respect to certain aspects of our business,\nincluding competing against Uber Freight with respect to freight brokerage.\nAdditionally, if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval of any acquisitions, we may not ultimately consummate such\nacquisitions, may be required to pay termination fees or may consummate them only in jurisdictions where antitrust approval is\nobtained. Further, in order to obtain regulatory approval of acquisitions, we may be required to divest all or part of our or the target\ncompany’s operations or agree to other remedies. Any such remedies could result in additional competition in some or all markets.\nFor all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors. Our inability to\ncompete effectively would have an adverse effect on, or otherwise harm, our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nTo remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we\nhave in the past offered, and may continue to offer, significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions, which\nhas adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our financial performance.\nTo remain competitive in certain markets and generate network scale and liquidity, we have in the past lowered, and may continue\nto lower, fares or service fees, and we have offered and may continue to offer significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts\nand promotions. At times, in certain geographic markets, we have offered, and may continue to offer, Driver incentives that cause the\ntotal amount of the fare that a Driver retains, combined with the Driver incentives a Driver receives from us, to increase, at times\nmeeting or exceeding the amount of Gross Bookings we generate for a given Trip. In certain geographic markets and regions, we do\nnot have a leading category position, which may result in us choosing to further increase the amount of Driver incentives and\nconsumer discounts and promotions that we offer in those geographic markets and regions. We cannot assure you that offering such\nDriver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions will be successful. Driver incentives, consumer discounts, promotions, and\nreductions in fares and our service fee have negatively affected, and will continue to negatively affect, our financial performance.\nAdditionally, we rely on pricing models to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings, which have been modified over time and will\nlikely in the future be modified, and pricing models at times vary based upon jurisdiction. We cannot assure you that our pricing\nmodels or strategies will be successful in attracting consumers and Drivers. For example, changes we have made in California to the\ninformation that Drivers see in the application, as well as pricing and offer structure changes, adversely impacted usage of the\napplication. If we are unable to successfully manage these and similar kinds of changes in the future, our business may be adversely\nimpacted.\nThe markets in which we compete have attracted significant investments from a wide range of funding sources, and we anticipate\nthat many of our competitors will continue to be highly capitalized. Moreover, certain of our stockholders have made substantial\ninvestments in certain of our competitors and may increase such investments, make new investments in other competitors, or enter\ninto strategic transactions with competitors in the future. These investments or strategic transactions, along with other competitive\nadvantages discussed above, may allow our competitors to compete more effectively against us and continue to lower their prices,\noffer Driver incentives or consumer discounts and promotions, or otherwise attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and\nCarriers to their platform and away from ours. Such competitive pressures may lead us to maintain or lower fares or service fees or\nmaintain or increase our Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions. Ridesharing and certain other categories in which\nwe compete are relatively nascent, and we cannot guarantee that they will stabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allow us to\nmaintain profitability.\nWe have incurred significant losses, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses to\nincrease in the foreseeable future, and we may not maintain profitability.\nWe incurred an operating loss of $1.8 billion in the year ended December 31, 2022, and as of December 31, 2024, we had an\naccumulated deficit of $20.7 billion. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levels and decrease proportionate\nexpenses in future periods to achieve or maintain profitability in many of our largest markets, including in the United States, and even\nif we do, we may not be able to maintain or increase profitability. We may incur losses in the near term as a result of substantial\nincreases in our operating expenses, as we continue to invest in order to: increase the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants,\nShippers, and Carriers using our platform through incentives, discounts, and promotions; expand within existing or into new markets;\nincrease our research and development expenses; expand marketing channels and operations; hire additional employees; and add new\nproducts and offerings to our platform. These efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate, and we may not succeed in\nincreasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these expenses. Many of our efforts to generate revenue are new and unproven, and any\nfailure to adequately increase revenue or contain the related costs could prevent us from attaining or increasing profitability. In\n13",
          "addition, we sometimes introduce new products that we expect to add value to our overall platform and network but which we expect\nwill generate lower Gross Bookings per Trip or a lower Revenue Margin. Further, we may charge a lower service fee to certain of our\nmerchant partners on our Delivery offering to grow the number of Delivery consumers, which may at times result in a negative\nRevenue Margin with respect to those transactions after considering amounts collected from consumers and paid to Drivers. As we\nexpand our offerings to additional cities, our offerings in these cities may be less profitable than the markets in which we currently\noperate. As such, we may not be able to maintain profitability in the near term, in accordance with our expectations, or at all.\nAdditionally, we may not realize the operating efficiencies we expect to achieve as a result of our prior or future acquisitions. Even if\nwe do experience operating efficiencies, our operating results may not improve, at least in the near term.\nIf we are unable to attract or maintain a sufficient number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, whether as a\nresult of competition or other factors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users, and our financial results would be\nadversely impacted.\nOur success in a given geographic market significantly depends on our ability to develop our network scale and liquidity in that\ngeographic market by attracting Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers to our platform. If Drivers choose not to offer\ntheir services through our platform, we may lack a sufficient supply of Drivers to attract consumers and merchants to our platform. We\nhave experienced and expect to continue to experience Driver supply constraints in most geographic markets in which we operate. To\nthe extent that we experience Driver supply constraints in a given market, we may need to increase or may not be able to reduce the\nDriver incentives that we offer without adversely affecting the supply liquidity that we experience in that market. Similarly, if Carriers\nchoose not to offer their services through our platform or elect to use other freight brokers, we may lack a sufficient supply of Carriers\nin specific geographic markets to attract Shippers to our platform. Furthermore, if merchants choose to partner with other delivery\nservices in a specific geographic market, or if merchants choose to engage exclusively with our competitors, other merchant marketing\nwebsites, or other delivery services, we may lack a sufficient variety and supply of restaurant and other merchant options, or lack\naccess to the most popular merchants, such that our Delivery offering will become less appealing to consumers and merchants. A\nsignificant amount of our Delivery Gross Bookings come from a limited number of large restaurant groups and other merchants, and\nthis concentration increases the risk of fluctuations in our operating results and our sensitivity to any material adverse developments\nexperienced by our significant merchant partners. If platform users choose to use other ridesharing, delivery, or logistics services, we\nmay lack sufficient opportunities for Drivers to earn a fare, Carriers to book a shipment, or merchants to provide their goods, which\nmay reduce the perceived utility of our platform. An insufficient supply of platform users would decrease our network liquidity and\nadversely affect our revenue and financial results. Although we may benefit from having larger scale and liquidity than some\ncompetitors, those network effects may not result in competitive advantages or may be overcome by smaller competitors. Maintaining\na balance between supply and demand in any given area at any given time and our ability to execute operationally may be more\nimportant to service quality than the absolute size of the network. If our service quality diminishes or our competitors’ products\nachieve greater market adoption, our competitors may be able to grow at a quicker rate than we do and may diminish our network\neffect.\nOur number of platform users may decline materially or fluctuate as a result of many factors, including, among other things,\ndissatisfaction with the operation of our platform, the price of fares, food, and shipments (including a reduction in incentives), broader\neconomic and labor market dynamics, changes in government policy, dissatisfaction with the quality of service provided by the\nDrivers and merchants on our platform, quality of platform user support, dissatisfaction with the merchant selection on Delivery,\nnegative publicity related to our brand, including as a result of safety incidents and corporate reporting related to safety, perceived\npolitical or geopolitical affiliations, a pandemic or an outbreak of disease or similar public health concern, or fear of such an event,\ntreatment of Drivers, perception that our culture has not fundamentally changed, dissatisfaction with changes we make to our products\nand offerings, or dissatisfaction with our products and offerings in general. In addition, if we are unable to provide high-quality\nsupport to platform users or respond to reported incidents, including safety incidents, in a timely and acceptable manner, our ability to\nattract and retain platform users could be adversely affected. If Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers do not establish\nor maintain active accounts with us, if a social media or other campaign encouraging users to cease use of our platform takes hold, if\nwe fail to provide high-quality support, or if we cannot otherwise attract and retain a large number of Drivers, consumers, merchants,\nShippers, and Carriers, our revenue would decline, and our business would suffer.\nThe number of Drivers and merchants on our platform could decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including\nDrivers ceasing to provide their services through our platform, passage or enforcement of local laws limiting our products and\nofferings, the low switching costs between competitor platforms or services, and dissatisfaction with our brand or reputation, pricing\nmodels (including potential reductions in incentives), ability to prevent safety incidents, or other aspects of our business. While we\naim to provide an earnings opportunity comparable to that available in retail, wholesale, or merchant services or other similar work,\nwe continue to experience dissatisfaction with our platform from a significant number of Drivers. In particular, as we aim to reduce\nDriver incentives to improve our financial performance, we expect Driver dissatisfaction will generally increase.\nOften, we are forced to make tradeoffs between the satisfaction of various platform users, as a change that one category of users\nviews as positive will likely be viewed as negative to another category of users. We also take certain measures to protect against fraud,\nhelp increase safety, and prevent privacy and security breaches, including terminating access to our platform for users with low ratings\nor reported incidents, and imposing certain qualifications for Drivers and merchants, which may damage our relationships with\n14",
          "platform users or discourage or diminish their use of our platform. Further, we are investing in our autonomous vehicle strategy, which\nmay add to Driver dissatisfaction over time, as it may reduce the need for Drivers. Driver dissatisfaction has in the past resulted in\nprotests by Drivers in various regions, including India, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Such protests have resulted, and\nany future protests may result, in interruptions to our business. Continued Driver dissatisfaction may also result in a decline in our\nnumber of platform users, which would reduce our network liquidity, and which in turn may cause a further decline in platform usage.\nAny decline in the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, or Carriers using our platform would reduce the value of our\nnetwork and would harm our future operating results.\nIn addition, changes in Driver qualification and background-check requirements may increase our costs and reduce our ability to\nonboard additional Drivers to our platform. Our Driver qualification and background check process varies by jurisdiction, and there\nhave been allegations, including from regulators, legislators, prosecutors, taxicab owners, and consumers, that our background check\nprocess is insufficient or inadequate. With respect to Drivers who are only eligible to make deliveries through Delivery, our\nqualification and background check standards are generally less extensive than the standards for Drivers who are eligible to provide\nrides through our Mobility products. Legislators and regulators may pass laws or adopt regulations in the future requiring Drivers to\nundergo a materially different type of qualification, screening, or background check process, or that limit our ability to access\ninformation used in the background check process in an efficient manner, which could be costly and time-consuming. Required\nchanges in the qualification, screening, and background check process (including any changes to such processes of Careem, Postmates\nor other acquired companies) could also reduce the number of Drivers in those markets or extend the time required to recruit new\nDrivers to our platform, which would adversely impact our business and growth. Furthermore, we rely on a single background-check\nprovider in certain jurisdictions, and we may not be able to arrange for adequate background checks from a different provider on\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all. The failure of this provider to provide background checks on a timely basis would result in\nour inability to onboard new Drivers or retain existing Drivers undergoing periodic background checks that are required to continue\nusing our platform.\nMaintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We receive significant media coverage,\nincluding negative publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our\nbrand and reputation, failure to maintain or enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.\nMaintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our ability to attract new employees and platform users, to\npreserve and deepen the engagement of our existing employees and platform users, and to mitigate legislative or regulatory scrutiny,\nlitigation, government investigations, and adverse platform user sentiment.\nWe receive a high degree of negative media coverage around the world, which adversely affects our brand and reputation and\nfuels distrust of our company. Negative publicity adversely affects our brand and reputation, makes it difficult for us to attract and\nretain platform users, reduces confidence in and use of our products and offerings, invites continued legislative and regulatory\nscrutiny, and results in additional litigation and governmental investigations. As a result, our competitors raised additional capital,\nincreased their investments in certain markets, and improved their category positions and market shares, and may continue to do so.\nIn 2024, we released a third safety report, which provides the public with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other\ncritical safety incidents claimed to have occurred on our platform in the United States. Public responses to our safety reports or any\nfuture safety reports or similar public reporting of safety incidents claimed to have occurred on our platform, which may include\ndisclosure of reports provided to regulators and other government authorities, as well as public responses to any third-party\nassessments of our civil rights impact, may continue to result in positive and negative media coverage, increased regulatory scrutiny,\nand litigation, and could adversely affect our reputation with platform users. Media coverage of litigation and of regulatory scrutiny\ncan also adversely affect our reputation and brand. Further unfavorable media coverage and negative publicity of these and other kinds\ncould adversely impact our financial results and future prospects. As our platform continues to scale and becomes increasingly\ninterconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public awareness of our brand, future damage to our brand and reputation\ncould have an amplified effect on our various platform offerings. Additionally, some of our acquired and majority-owned companies,\nincluding Careem, Postmates and Cornershop, have or will continue to use their own brands and/or operate their own apps in parallel\nwith our brand and apps, and any damage or reputational harm to their brands could adversely impact our brand and reputation.\nOur brand and reputation might also be harmed by events outside of our control. For example, we have licensed our brand in\nconnection with certain divestitures and joint ventures, including to Yandex in Russia/CIS, and while we have certain contractual\nprotections in place governing the use of our brand by these companies, we do not control these businesses, we are not able to\nanticipate their actions, and consumers may not be aware that these service providers are not controlled by us. Furthermore, if Drivers,\nmerchants, or Carriers provide diminished quality of service, are involved in incidents regarding safety or privacy, engage in\nmalfeasance, or otherwise violate the law, we may receive unfavorable press coverage and our reputation and business may be\nharmed. As a result, any of these third parties could take actions that result in harm to our brand, reputation, and consequently, our\nbusiness.\nWhile we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will\ndepend largely on maintaining a good reputation, minimizing the number of safety incidents, continuing an improved culture and\nworkplace practices, improving our compliance programs, continuing to invest in safety features and improvements, maintaining a\n15",
          "high quality of service and ethical behavior, and continuing our marketing and public relations efforts. Our brand promotion,\nreputation building, and media strategies have involved significant costs and may not be successful. We anticipate that other\ncompetitors and potential competitors will expand their offerings, which will make maintaining and enhancing our reputation and\nbrand increasingly more difficult and expensive. If we fail to successfully maintain our brand in the current or future competitive\nenvironment or if events occur in the future which negatively affect public perception of our company, our brand and reputation would\nbe further damaged and our business may suffer.\nIf we fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform or fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our\ncompetitors, or if such technologies fail to perform as expected, are inferior to those offered by our competitors, or are perceived as\nless safe than those offered by competitors or non-autonomous vehicles, our financial performance and prospects would be\nadversely impacted.\nWe have invested, and we may continue to invest, substantial amounts in companies with whom we partner to offer autonomous\nvehicle technologies on our platform. For example, in January 2021, we completed the merger of our autonomous technologies\nbusiness with Aurora, and included a $400 million investment in the combined company and a commercial agreement pursuant to\nwhich we and Aurora will collaborate with respect to the launch and commercialization of self-driving vehicles on our ridesharing\nnetwork. Additionally, we have entered into commercial partnerships with various autonomous mobility and/or autonomous delivery\ncompanies. We believe that autonomous vehicle technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact the industries in which we\ncompete and that autonomous vehicles present substantial opportunities. Several companies other than Aurora, including Waymo,\nTesla, Zoox (a subsidiary of Amazon), Motional, Avride and Nuro, are developing autonomous vehicle technologies in the United\nStates, either alone or through collaborations with car manufacturers, as are similar companies globally, and we expect that they will\nuse such technology to further compete with us in the mobility, delivery, or logistics industries. Waymo has introduced a\ncommercialized ridehailing fleet of autonomous vehicles on its own platform in addition to a fleet of autonomous vehicles that it\nmakes available through our platform, and it is possible that our competitors could introduce autonomous vehicle offerings earlier than\nwe will be able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform or that our commercial partnerships could expire or that our autonomous\nvehicle partners could experience organizational failures of their own or otherwise remove their vehicles from our platform. In the\nevent that our competitors bring autonomous vehicles to market before we are able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform,\ndeploy their autonomous vehicles on ridesharing, delivery or logistics platforms other than ours, or their technology is or is perceived\nto be superior to the technology of parties with which we partner to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, they may be able to\nleverage such technology to compete more effectively with us, which would adversely impact our financial performance and our\nprospects. For example, use of autonomous vehicles could substantially reduce the cost of providing ridesharing, delivery, or logistics\nservices, which could allow competitors to offer such services at a substantially lower price as compared to the price available to\nconsumers on our platform. If a significant number of consumers choose to use our competitors’ offerings over ours, our financial\nperformance and prospects would be adversely impacted.\nAutonomous vehicle technologies involve significant risks and liabilities. Collisions, including fatal collisions, have happened.\nFailures of autonomous vehicle technologies that we may offer on our platform or crashes involving autonomous vehicles using the\ntechnology of our partners, could generate substantial liability for us, create negative publicity about us, or result in regulatory\nscrutiny, all of which would have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, prospects, and operating results.\nFederal and state government regulations specifically designed to govern autonomous vehicle operation, testing and/or\nmanufacture are developing. These regulations could include requirements that delay or limit our ability to offer autonomous vehicles\non our platform. If regulations of this nature are implemented, we may not be able to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our\nplatform in the manner we expect, or at all. Further, if we or parties with which we partner to offer autonomous vehicle technologies\nare unable to comply with existing or new regulations or laws applicable to autonomous vehicles, we and our partners could become\nsubject to substantial fines or penalties.\nOur workforce and operations have grown substantially since our inception and we have in the past implemented several\nreductions in workforce. If we are unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth or any future\nreductions in workforce, our financial performance and future prospects will be adversely affected.\nSince our inception, we have experienced rapid growth in the United States and internationally. This expansion increases the\ncomplexity of our business and has placed, and will continue to place, significant strain on our management, personnel, operations,\nsystems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to\nmanage our growth effectively, which could damage our reputation and negatively affect our operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 31,100 global employees, of whom approximately 18,000 were located outside\nthe United States. The total number of our employees located outside the United States has increased and may continue to increase as\nwe expand globally. Properly managing our growth will require us to continue to hire, train, and manage qualified employees and\nstaff, including engineers, operations personnel, financial and accounting staff, and sales and marketing staff, and to improve and\nmaintain our technology. If our new hires perform poorly, if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing, and integrating new\nemployees and staff, or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees and staff, our business may be harmed. Moreover,\nin order to optimize our organizational structure, we have implemented several reductions in workforce and restructurings, and may in\n16",
          "the future implement other reductions in workforce. Any reduction in workforce or restructuring may yield unintended consequences\nand costs, such as attrition beyond the intended reduction in workforce, the distraction of employees, or reduced employee morale and\ncould adversely affect our reputation as an employer, which could make it more difficult for us to hire new employees in the future\nand increase the risk that we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the reduction in workforce. Properly managing our growth\nor any reductions in workforce will require us to establish consistent policies across regions and functions, and a failure to do so could\nlikewise harm our business.\nOur failure to upgrade our technology or network infrastructure effectively to support our growth could result in unanticipated\nsystem disruptions, slow response times, or poor experiences for Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers. To manage\nthe growth of our operations and personnel and improve the technology that supports our business operations, as well as our financial\nand management systems, disclosure controls and procedures, and internal controls over financial reporting, we will be required to\ncommit substantial financial, operational, and technical resources. In particular, we will need to improve our transaction processing\nand reporting, operational, and financial systems, procedures, and controls. For example, due to our significant growth, especially with\nrespect to our high-growth emerging offerings like Delivery and Freight, we face challenges in timely and appropriately designing\ncontrols in response to evolving risks of material misstatement. These improvements are and will be particularly challenging when we\nacquire new businesses with different systems. Our current and planned personnel, systems, procedures, and controls may not be\nadequate to support our future operations. If we are unable to expand our operations and hire additional qualified personnel in an\nefficient manner, or if our operational technology is insufficient to reliably service Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, or\nCarriers, platform user satisfaction will be adversely affected and may cause platform users to switch to our competitors’ platforms,\nwhich would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur organizational structure is complex and will continue to grow as we add additional Drivers, consumers, merchants, Carriers,\nShippers, employees, products and offerings, and technologies, and as we continue to expand globally. We will need to improve our\noperational, financial, and management controls as well as our reporting systems and procedures to support the growth of our\norganizational structure. We will require capital and management resources to grow and mature in these areas. If we are unable to\neffectively manage the growth of our business, the quality of our platform may suffer, and we may be unable to address competitive\nchallenges, which would adversely affect our overall business, operations, and financial condition.\nOur historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges, and a\nfailure to address these challenges would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\nOur historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created significant operational and cultural challenges that have in\nthe past harmed, and may in the future continue to harm, our business results and financial condition. Our prior failure to prioritize\ncompliance has led to increased regulatory scrutiny globally. Although we have since made changes in our company’s cultural values\nand composition of our leadership team and have an ongoing commitment to promote transparency and collaboration, regulators may\ncontinue to perceive us negatively, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\nIf platform users engage in, or are subject to, criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major safety\nincidents, our ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers may be harmed, which could\nhave an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe are not able to control or predict the actions of platform users and third parties, either during their use of our platform or\notherwise, and we may be unable to protect or provide a safe environment for Drivers and consumers as a result of certain actions by\nDrivers, consumers, merchants, Carriers, and third parties. Such actions may result in injuries, property damage, or loss of life for\nconsumers and third parties, or business interruption, brand and reputational damage, or significant liabilities for us. Although we\nadminister certain qualification processes for users of our platform, including background checks on Drivers through third-party\nservice providers in the United States, these qualification processes and background checks may not expose all potentially relevant\ninformation and are limited in certain jurisdictions according to national and local laws, and our third-party service providers where\nutilized may fail to conduct such background checks adequately or disclose information that could be relevant to a determination of\neligibility. Further, the qualification and background check standards for Couriers are generally less extensive than those conducted for\nMobility Drivers. In addition, we do not independently test Drivers’ driving skills. Consequently, we expect to continue to receive\ncomplaints from riders and other consumers, as well as actual or threatened legal action against us related to Driver conduct. We have\nalso faced civil litigation alleging, among other things, inadequate Driver qualification processes and background checks, and general\nmisrepresentations regarding the safety of our platform.\nIf Drivers or Carriers, or individuals impersonating Drivers or Carriers, engage in criminal activity, misconduct, or inappropriate\nconduct or use our platform as a conduit for criminal activity, consumers and Shippers may not consider our products and offerings\nsafe, and we may receive negative press coverage as a result of our business relationship with such Driver or Carrier, which would\nadversely impact our brand, reputation, and business. There have been numerous incidents and allegations worldwide of Drivers, or\nindividuals impersonating Drivers, sexually assaulting, abusing, kidnapping and/or fatally injuring consumers, or otherwise engaging\nin criminal activity while using our platform or claiming to use our platform. Furthermore, if consumers engage in criminal activity or\nmisconduct while using our platform, Drivers and merchants may be unwilling to continue using our platform. In addition, certain\nregions where we operate have high rates of violent crime, which has impacted Drivers and consumers in those regions. For example,\n17",
          "in Latin America, there have been numerous reports of Drivers and consumers being victimized by violent crime, such as armed\nrobbery, violent assault, and rape, while taking or providing a trip on our platform. If other criminal, inappropriate, or other negative\nincidents occur due to the conduct of platform users or third parties, our ability to attract platform users may be harmed, and our\nbusiness and financial results could be adversely affected.\nPublic reporting or disclosure of reported safety information, including information about safety incidents reportedly occurring on\nor related to our platform, whether generated by us or third parties such as media or regulators, may adversely impact our business and\nfinancial results.\nFurther, we may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, deaths, injuries, or other incidents that are\ncaused by Drivers, consumers, or third parties while using our platform, or even when Drivers, consumers, or third parties are not\nactively using our platform. On a smaller scale, we may face litigation related to claims by Drivers for the actions of consumers or\nthird parties. Furthermore, operating a motor vehicle is inherently dangerous. In addition, the growth of our Delivery offering and\nlaunch of lower-cost product types has led to an increase in Drivers and consumers on two wheel vehicles such as scooters and\nbicycles, who are more vulnerable road users and face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while\ndriving in a vehicle. For example, urban hazards such as unpaved or uneven roadways increase the risk and severity of potential\ninjuries. In addition, Drivers, in particular those on two wheel vehicles predominantly in metropolitan areas, need to share, navigate,\nand at times contend with narrow and heavily congested roads occupied by cars, buses and light rail, especially during “rush” hours,\nall of which heighten the potential risk of injuries or death. Our auto liability and general liability insurance policies may not cover all\npotential claims to which we are exposed, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability. These incidents may subject us to\nliability, negative publicity, and regulatory scrutiny, which would increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business,\noperating results, and future prospects. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we will incur significant costs in investigating\nand defending against them. As we expand our products and offerings, this insurance risk will grow.\nWe are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future. These\nnew ventures are inherently risky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them.\nWe have made substantial investments to develop new offerings and technologies, and we intend to continue investing significant\nresources in developing new technologies, tools, features, services, products and offerings. For example, through our acquisition of\nCornershop, a provider of online grocery delivery in several countries including Mexico and Chile, we expanded our Delivery offering\nto grocery delivery. Additionally, in October 2021, we acquired The Drizly Group, Inc. in order to further expand our Delivery\noffering to alcohol. In November 2021, our subsidiary Uber Freight acquired Transplace, expanding Uber Freight’s business through\nTransplace’s expertise in transportation management. We also plan to invest resources to develop offerings and technologies in the\nmarkets in which Postmates operate. If we do not spend our development budget efficiently or effectively on commercially successful\nand innovative technologies, we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategy. Our new initiatives also have a high degree of\nrisk, as each involves nascent industries and unproven business strategies and technologies with which we have limited or no prior\ndevelopment or operating experience. Because such offerings and technologies are new, they will likely involve claims and liabilities\n(including, but not limited to, personal injury claims), expenses, regulatory challenges, and other risks, some of which we do not\ncurrently anticipate.\nThere can be no assurance that consumer demand for such initiatives will exist or be sustained at the levels that we anticipate, or\nthat any of these initiatives will gain sufficient traction or market acceptance to generate sufficient revenue to offset any new expenses\nor liabilities associated with these new investments. It is also possible that products and offerings developed by others will render our\nproducts and offerings noncompetitive or obsolete. Further, our development efforts with respect to new products, offerings and\ntechnologies could distract management from current operations, and will divert capital and other resources from our more established\nproducts, offerings and technologies. Even if we are successful in developing new products, offerings or technologies, regulatory\nauthorities may subject us to new rules or restrictions in response to our innovations that could increase our expenses or prevent us\nfrom successfully commercializing new products, offerings or technologies. If we do not realize the expected benefits of our\ninvestments, our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects may be harmed.\nOur business is substantially dependent on operations outside the United States, including those in markets in which we have\nlimited experience, and if we are unable to manage the risks presented by our business model internationally, our financial results\nand future prospects will be adversely impacted.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we operated in over 70 countries. We have limited experience operating in many jurisdictions outside\nof the United States and have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments to expand our international operations\nand compete with local and other global competitors.\nConducting our business internationally, particularly in countries in which we have limited experience, subjects us to risks that we\ndo not face to the same degree in the United States. These risks include, among others:\n• operational and compliance challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences;\n• the resources required to localize our business, which requires the translation of our mobile app and website into foreign\nlanguages and the adaptation of our operations to local practices, laws, and regulations and any changes in such practices,\n18",
          "laws, and regulations;\n• laws and regulations more restrictive than those in the United States, including laws governing competition, pricing,\npayment methods, Internet activities, transportation services (such as taxis and vehicles for hire), transportation network\ncompanies (such as ridesharing), logistics services, payment processing and payment gateways, real estate tenancy laws,\ntax and social security laws, employment and labor laws, driver screening and background checks, licensing regulations,\nemail messaging, privacy, location services, collection, use, processing, or sharing of personal information, ownership of\nintellectual property, and other activities important to our business;\n• competition with companies or other services (such as taxis or vehicles for hire) that understand local markets better than\nwe do, that have pre-existing relationships with potential platform users in those markets, or that are favored by\ngovernment or regulatory authorities in those markets;\n• differing levels of social acceptance of our brand, products, and offerings;\n• differing levels of technological compatibility with our platform;\n• exposure to business cultures in which improper business practices may be prevalent;\n• legal uncertainty regarding our liability for the actions of platform users and third parties, including uncertainty resulting\nfrom unique local laws or a lack of clear legal precedent;\n• difficulties in managing, growing, and staffing international operations, including in countries in which foreign employees\nmay become part of labor unions, employee representative bodies, or collective bargaining agreements, and challenges\nrelating to work stoppages or slowdowns;\n• fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n• managing operations in markets in which cash transactions are favored over credit or debit cards;\n• regulations governing the control of local currencies that impact our ability to collect fares on behalf of Drivers and remit\nthose funds to Drivers in the same currencies, as well as higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;\n• adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added and digital services tax systems, and\nrestrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n• increased financial accounting and reporting burdens, and complexities associated with implementing and maintaining\nadequate internal controls;\n• difficulties in implementing and maintaining the financial systems and processes needed to enable compliance across\nmultiple offerings and jurisdictions;\n• import and export restrictions and changes in trade regulation;\n• political, social, and economic instability abroad, war, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and conflicts in\nthe Middle East, terrorist attacks and security concerns in general, and societal crime conditions that harm or disrupt the\nglobal economy and/or can directly impact platform users;\n• public health concerns or emergencies, including pandemics and other highly communicable diseases or viruses,\noutbreaks of which have from time to time occurred in various parts of the world in which we operate; and\n• reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some markets.\nThese risks could adversely affect our international operations, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and operating results.\nWe have limited influence over our minority-owned entities, which subjects us to substantial risks, including potential loss of value.\nOur growth strategy has included the restructuring of our business and assets by divesting our business and assets in certain\njurisdictions and partnering with and investing in local ridesharing, and delivery companies to participate in those markets rather than\noperate in those markets independently. Our growth strategy has also included the divestment of certain lines of business in their\nentirety, and not just in certain jurisdictions, and instead partnering and investing in other companies in those lines of business. As a\nresult, a significant portion of our assets includes minority ownership positions, including in Didi, Grab, and Aurora.\nOur ownership in these entities involves significant risks that are outside our control. As a result, these companies may make\ndecisions or take actions with which we disagree or that may be harmful to the value of our ownership in these companies.\nAdditionally, these companies have expanded their offerings, and we expect them to continue to expand their offerings in the future.\nWhile this could enhance the value of our ownership interest in these companies, our business, financial condition, operating results,\nand prospects would be adversely affected by such expansion.\n19",
          "Any material decline in the business of these entities would adversely affect the value of our assets and our financial results.\nFurthermore, the value of these assets is based in part on the market valuations of these entities, and weakened financial markets have\nadversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect such valuations. To the extent these businesses are or become publicly\ntraded companies, volatility or fluctuations in the stock price of such companies could adversely impact our financial results. These\npositions could expose us to risks, litigation, and unknown liabilities because, among other things, these companies have limited\noperating histories in evolving industries and may have less predictable operating results; to the extent these companies are privately\nowned, limited public information is available and we may not learn all the material information regarding these businesses; are\ndomiciled and operate in countries with particular economic, tax, political, legal, safety, regulatory and public health risks; are\ndomiciled or operate in countries that may become subject to economic sanctions or foreign investment restrictions; depend on the\nmanagement talents and efforts of a small group of individuals, and, as a result, the death, disability, resignation, or termination of one\nor more of these individuals could have an adverse effect on the relevant company’s operations; and will likely require substantial\nadditional capital to support their operations and expansion and to maintain their competitive positions.\nFurther, we are contractually limited in our ability to sell or transfer these assets. For example, in connection with Aurora’s\nNovember 2021 initial public offering, we are subject to a 4-year lock-up with respect to our shares in Aurora. Furthermore, we may\nbe required to sell these assets at a time at which we would not be able to realize what we believe to be the long-term value of these\nassets. For example, if we were deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the\n“Investment Company Act”), we may be required to sell some or all of such assets so that we would not be subject to the requirements\nof the Investment Company Act. Additionally, we may have to pay significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of these assets.\nAccordingly, we may never realize the value of these assets relative to the contributions we made to these businesses.\nWe may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results. If we are unable to achieve or sustain profitability, our\nprospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their investment.\nOur operating results may vary significantly and are not necessarily an indication of future performance. These fluctuations may\nbe a result of a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our\nfinancial results. For Mobility, we typically generate higher revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to\nfourth quarter holiday and business demand, and typically generate lower revenue in our first quarter compared to other quarters due\nin part to less usage of our platform as holiday demand slows down. We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth\nin Mobility trends in the first quarter. For Delivery, we expect to experience seasonal increases in our revenue in the fourth quarter\ncompared to other quarters, although the historical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations. Our growth has made,\nand may in the future make, seasonal fluctuations difficult to detect. We expect these seasonal trends to become more pronounced over\ntime as our growth slows. Other seasonal trends may develop or these existing seasonal trends may become more extreme, which\nwould contribute to fluctuations in our operating results. In addition to seasonality, our operating results may fluctuate as a result of\nfactors including our ability to attract and retain new platform users, increased competition in the markets in which we operate, our\nability to expand our operations in new and existing markets, our ability to maintain an adequate growth rate and effectively manage\nthat growth, our ability to keep pace with technological changes in the industries in which we operate, changes in governmental or\nother regulations affecting our business, harm to our brand or reputation, and other risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K. As such, we may not accurately forecast our operating results. We base our expense levels and investment plans on\nestimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly\nenough if our revenue is less than expected, resulting in losses that exceed our expectations. If we are unable to achieve sustained\nprofits, our prospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their investment.\nIf our growth slows more significantly than we currently expect, we may not be able to maintain profitability, which would\nadversely affect our financial results and future prospects.\nWe believe that our growth depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n• grow supply and demand on our platform;\n• increase existing platform users’ activity on our platform;\n• continue to introduce our platform to new markets;\n• provide high-quality support to Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers;\n• expand our business and increase our market share and category position;\n• compete with the products and offerings of, and pricing and incentives offered by, our competitors;\n• develop new products, offerings, and technologies;\n• identify and acquire or invest in businesses, products, offerings, or technologies that we believe could complement or\nexpand our platform;\n• penetrate suburban and rural areas and increase the number of rides taken on our platform outside metropolitan areas;\n20",
          "• reduce the costs of our Mobility offering to better compete with personal vehicle ownership and usage and other low-cost\nalternatives like public transportation, which in many cases can be faster or cheaper than any other form of transportation;\n• maintain existing local regulations in key markets where we operate;\n• enter or expand operations in some of the key countries in which we are currently limited by local regulations, such as\nArgentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain; and\n• increase positive perception of our brand.\nWe may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives. In addition, circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our\nDelivery offering stemming from stay-at-home order demand related to the pandemic may not continue in the future. A softening of\nDriver, consumer, merchant, Shipper, or Carrier demand, whether caused by changes in the preferences of such parties, failure to\nmaintain our brand, changes in the U.S. or global economies, pandemics, licensing fees in various jurisdictions, competition, or other\nfactors, may result in decreased revenue or growth and our financial results and future prospects would be adversely impacted. We\nexpect to continue to incur significant expenses, and if we cannot increase our revenue at a faster rate than the increase in our\nexpenses, we will not achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas and trips to and from airports.\nIf our operations in large metropolitan areas or our ability to provide trips to and from airports are negatively affected, our\nfinancial results and future prospects would be adversely impacted.\nIn 2024, we derived 20% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from five metropolitan areas—Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York\nCity in the United States, Sao Paulo in Brazil, and London in the United Kingdom. We experience strong competition in large\nmetropolitan areas, which has led us to offer significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions in these large\nmetropolitan areas. As a result of our geographic concentration, our business and financial results are susceptible to economic, social,\nweather, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances in each of these large metropolitan areas. Outbreaks of contagious diseases\nor other viruses could lead to a sustained decline in the desirability of living, working and congregating in metropolitan areas in which\nwe operate. Any short-term or long-term shifts in the travel patterns of consumers away from metropolitan areas, due to health\nconcerns regarding epidemics or pandemics could have an adverse impact on our Mobility Gross Bookings from these areas. An\neconomic downturn, increased competition, or regulatory obstacles in any of these key metropolitan areas would adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results to a much greater degree than would the occurrence of such events in other areas.\nIn addition, any changes to local laws or regulations within these key metropolitan areas that affect our ability to operate or increase\nour operating expenses in these markets would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if we are unable to renew existing\nlicenses or do not receive new licenses in key metropolitan areas where we operate or such licenses are terminated, any inability to\noperate in such metropolitan area, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results.\nFurther, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our\nnetwork is smaller and less liquid, the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient.\nIf we are not successful in penetrating suburban and rural areas, or if we are unable to operate in certain key metropolitan areas in the\nfuture, our ability to serve what we consider to be our total addressable market would be limited, and our business, financial condition,\nand operating results would suffer.\nIn 2024, we generated 15% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from trips that either started or were completed at an airport. As a\nresult of this concentration, our operating results are susceptible to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability\nof drivers using our platform to provide trips to and from airports. Sustained declines in air travel have in the past, and may in the\nfuture, suppress demand for airport-related Mobility and reduce our Mobility Gross Bookings from airport trips. For example, during\nthe height of the pandemic, travel behavior changed and airline travel slowed, reducing the demand for Mobility to and from airports.\nCertain airports currently regulate ridesharing within airport boundaries, including by mandating that ridesharing service providers\nobtain airport-specific licenses, and some airports, particularly those outside the United States, have banned ridesharing operations\naltogether. Despite such bans, some Drivers continue to provide Mobility services, including trips to and from airports, despite lacking\nthe requisite permits. Such actions may result in the imposition of fines or sanctions, including further bans on our ability to operate\nwithin airport boundaries, against us or Drivers. Additional bans on our airport operations, or any permitting requirements or instances\nof non-compliance by Drivers, would significantly disrupt our operations. In addition, if drop-offs or pick-ups of riders become\ninconvenient because of airport rules or regulations, or more expensive because of airport-imposed fees, the number of Drivers or\nconsumers could decrease, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. While we have\nentered into agreements with most major U.S. airports as well as certain airports outside the United States to allow the use of our\nplatform within airport boundaries, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew such agreements on favorable terms if at all, and\nwe may not be successful in negotiating similar agreements with airports in all jurisdictions.\nOur business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful\nsuccession planning could adversely affect our business.\n21",
          "Our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other\npersonnel who are in high demand, are often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our\ncompetitors. Challenges related to our historical culture and workplace practices and negative publicity we experience have in the past\nled to significant attrition and made it more difficult to attract high-quality employees. Our employees worked from home for almost\ntwo years in light of the pandemic, and although we have implemented our “return to office” plan, which includes a shift to a hybrid\nmodel where employees have flexibility to work from home, a hybrid model may create challenges, including challenges maintaining\nour corporate culture, productivity and availability of key personnel and other employees necessary to conduct our business,\nincreasing attrition or limiting our ability to attract employees if individuals prefer to work full time at home or in the office. Future\nchallenges related to our culture and workplace practices or additional negative publicity could lead to further attrition and difficulty\nattracting high-quality employees.\nFuture leadership transitions and management changes may cause uncertainty in, or a disruption to, our business, and may\nincrease the likelihood of senior management or other employee turnover. The loss of qualified executives and employees, or an\ninability to attract, retain, and motivate high-quality executives and employees required for the planned expansion of our business,\nmay harm our operating results and impair our ability to grow.\nIn addition, we depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer\nDara Khosrowshahi. We have entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Khosrowshahi, which is at-will and has no specific\nduration.\nOur failure to put in place adequate succession plans for senior and key management roles or the failure of key employees to\nsuccessfully transition into new roles, for example, as a result of reductions in workforce, organizational changes and attrition, could\nhave an adverse effect on our business and operating results. The unexpected or abrupt departure of one or more of our key personnel\nand the failure to effectively transfer knowledge and effect smooth key personnel transitions has had and may in the future have an\nadverse effect on our business resulting from the loss of such person’s skills, knowledge of our business, and years of industry\nexperience. If we cannot effectively manage leadership transitions and management changes in the future, our reputation and future\nbusiness prospects could be adversely affected.\nTo attract and retain key personnel, we use equity incentives, among other measures. These measures may not be sufficient to\nattract and retain the personnel we require to operate our business effectively. Further, the equity incentives we currently use to attract,\nretain, and motivate employees may not be as effective as in the past, particularly if the value of the underlying stock does not increase\ncommensurate with expectations or consistent with our historical stock price growth. If we are unable to attract and retain high-quality\nmanagement and operating personnel, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition,\nwe rely heavily on equity as a component of compensation, which may not always align with the Company’s business and financial\ninterests.\nWe have experienced, and may again experience security or privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of,\ndisclosure of, alteration of or destruction of our proprietary or confidential data, employee data, or platform user data, which could\ncause loss of revenue, harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities.\nWe collect, use, and process a variety of personal data, such as email addresses, mobile phone numbers, profile photos, location\ninformation, drivers’ license numbers and Social Security numbers of Drivers, consumer payment card information, and Driver and\nmerchant bank account information. As such, we are an attractive target of data security attacks by third parties and insiders. Any\nfailure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access to, or use, acquisition, disclosure, alteration or destruction of, any\nsuch data could result in significant liability and a material loss of revenue resulting from the adverse impact on our reputation and\nbrand, a diminished ability to retain or attract new platform users, and disruption to our business. We rely on third-party service\nproviders to host or otherwise process some of our data and that of platform users, and they have experienced, and may again\nexperience, security and privacy incidents. Any failure by such third party to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access\nto, or use, acquisition, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of, such data could have similar adverse consequences for us.\nBecause the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade services, or sabotage systems change frequently\nand are often unrecognizable until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques and implement adequate\npreventative measures. Our servers, internal systems, and platform may be vulnerable to computer viruses or physical or electronic\nbreak-ins that our security measures may not detect. Individuals able to circumvent our security measures, or insiders who violate our\npolicies, may misappropriate confidential, proprietary, or personal information held by or on behalf of us, disrupt our operations,\ndamage our computers, or otherwise damage our business. In addition, we may need to expend significant resources to protect against\nsecurity breaches or mitigate the impact of any such breaches, including potential liability that may not be limited to the amounts\ncovered by our insurance.\nSecurity breaches could also expose us to liability under various laws and regulations across jurisdictions and increase the risk of\nlitigation and governmental investigation. We have been subject to security and privacy incidents in the past and may be again in the\nfuture. For example, in September 2022, we experienced a cybersecurity incident where an attacker accessed certain internal corporate\nsystems, tools and data. In October and November of 2016, outside actors downloaded the personal data of approximately 57 million\nDrivers and consumers worldwide (the “2016 Breach”). The accessed data included the names, email addresses, mobile phone\n22",
          "numbers, and drivers’ license numbers of approximately 600,000 Drivers, among other information. For further information on this\nincident, see the risk factor titled “—We face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data,\nwhich could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative, and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy\nand data protection practices,” below. As we expand our operations, we may also assume liabilities for breaches experienced by the\ncompanies we acquire. For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatory authorities that it had\nbeen subject to a data security incident that allowed access to certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform, as of\nJanuary 14, 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data security incidents, or if we fail to remediate\nthis or any other data security incident that Careem or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and\nsignificant liabilities. If we fail to remediate any other data security incident that we experience, we may face harm to our brand,\nbusiness disruption, and significant liabilities. Security and privacy incidents have led to, and may continue to lead to, additional\nregulatory scrutiny.\nCyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, denial of service attacks, account takeovers, spamming, phishing\nand social engineering attacks could harm our reputation, business, and operating results.\nWe rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations. Our information technology systems, including mobile\nand online platforms and mobile payment systems, administrative functions such as human resources, payroll, accounting, and internal\nand external communications, and the information technology systems of our third-party business partners and service providers,\ncontain proprietary or confidential information related to business and personal data, including sensitive personal data, entrusted to us\nby platform users, employees, and job candidates, and make us a target for threat actors. Cyberattacks that leverage computer\nmalware, ransomware, viruses, denial of service attacks, account takeovers, spamming, phishing, and social engineering have become\nmore prevalent, have occurred on our systems in the past, and may occur on our systems in the future. Cyberthreats are constantly\nevolving and employing more sophisticated attack techniques. Our detection capabilities may not be sufficient to prevent or detect a\nsophisticated cyberattacker. Breaches of our facilities, network, applications, identity management solutions or data security have in\nthe past and could in the future disrupt our business or the security of our systems and platforms, impair our ability to protect data,\ncompromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of\nour intellectual property or other assets, subject us to regulatory scrutiny or legal liability, require us to allocate more resources to\nimprove technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our reputation, business and operating results. In addition, our hybrid and remote\nworking arrangements may heighten the foregoing risks.\nVarious other factors may also cause system failures or security breaches, including power outages, catastrophic events,\ninadequate or ineffective redundancy, issues with upgrading or creating new systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or\nservices, intentional acts or errors by our employees or third-party service providers, or breaches in the security of these systems or\nplatforms. For example, fraudsters may attempt to induce employees, contractors, or platform users to disclose information to gain\naccess to our data or the data of platform users. If our incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity plans do not\nresolve these issues in an effective manner, they could result in adverse impacts to our business operations and our financial results.\nBecause of our prominence, the number of platform users, and the types and volume of personal data on our systems, we may be a\nparticularly attractive target for such attacks. Although we have developed, and continue to develop, systems and processes that are\ndesigned to protect our data and that of platform users, and to prevent data loss, undesirable activities on our platform, and security\nbreaches, we cannot guarantee that such measures will provide absolute security. Our efforts on this front may be unsuccessful as a\nresult of, for example, software bugs or other technical malfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance;\ngovernment surveillance; or other threats that evolve, and we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating\ncyberattacks. Any actual or perceived failure to maintain the performance, reliability, security, and availability of our products,\nofferings, and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of platform users, shareholders and certain regulators would likely harm our\nreputation and result in loss of revenue from the adverse impact to our reputation and brand, disruption to our business, and our\ndecreased ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers.\nIf we are unable to successfully introduce new or upgraded products, offerings, or features for Drivers, consumers, merchants,\nShippers, and Carriers, we may fail to retain and attract such users to our platform and our operating results would be adversely\naffected.\nTo continue to retain and attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers to our platform, we will need to continue\nto invest in the development of new products, offerings, and features that add value for Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and\nCarriers and that differentiate us from our competitors. For example, in January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in\nCalifornia intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information about rider destinations, trip distance, and expected\nfares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to further strengthen the\nindependence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform.\nDeveloping and delivering new or upgraded products, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products,\nofferings, and features depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such\nproducts, offerings, and features. Moreover, any such new or upgraded products, offerings, or features may not work as intended or\nmay not provide intended value to platform users. For example, some product changes in California have resulted in, and may\ncontinue to result in, reduced demand for rides and reduced supply of Drivers on our platform, Driver dissatisfaction, and adverse\n23",
          "impacts on the operation of our platform. If we are unable to continue to develop new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, or\nif platform users do not perceive value in such new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, platform users may choose not to\nuse our platform, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nWe track certain operational metrics and our category position with internal systems and tools, and our equity stakes in minority-\nowned entities with information provided by such minority-owned entities, and do not independently verify such metrics. Certain of\nour operational metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may\nharm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\nWe track certain operational metrics, including key metrics such as MAPCs, Trips, Gross Bookings, and our category position,\nwith internal systems and tools, and our equity stakes in minority-owned entities with information provided by such minority-owned\nentities, that are not independently verified by any third party and which may differ from estimates or similar metrics published by\nthird parties due to differences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions on which we rely. Our internal systems and tools have a\nnumber of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in unexpected\nchanges to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose, or our estimates of our category position. If the internal systems\nand tools we use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data\nwe report may not be accurate. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the\napplicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how our products are used across large populations\nglobally. For example, we believe that there are consumers who have multiple accounts, even though we prohibit that in our Terms of\nService and implement measures to detect and prevent that behavior. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to how we measure\ndata or with respect to the data that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our\nlong-term strategies. If our operating metrics or our estimates of our category position or our equity stakes in our minority-owned\nentities are not accurate representations of our business, or if investors do not perceive our operating metrics or estimates of our\ncategory position or equity stakes in our minority-owned entities to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to\nthese figures, our reputation may be significantly harmed, and our operating and financial results could be adversely affected.\nIn certain jurisdictions, we allow consumers to pay for rides and meal or grocery deliveries using cash, which raises regulatory,\noperational, and safety concerns. If we do not successfully manage those concerns, we could become subject to adverse regulatory\nactions and suffer reputational harm or other adverse financial and accounting consequences.\nIn certain jurisdictions, including India, Brazil, and Mexico, as well as certain other countries in Latin America, Europe, the\nMiddle East, and Africa, we allow consumers to use cash to pay Drivers the entire fare of rides and cost of meal deliveries (including\nour service fee from such rides and meal or grocery deliveries). In 2024, cash-paid trips accounted for approximately 6% of our global\nGross Bookings. This percentage may increase in the future, particularly in the markets in which Careem operates. The number of\ncountries and product types where cash is accepted is expected to continue to increase. The use of cash in connection with our\ntechnology raises regulatory, operational, and safety concerns. For example, many jurisdictions have specific regulations regarding the\nuse of cash for ridesharing and certain jurisdictions prohibit the use of cash for ridesharing. Failure to comply with these regulations\ncould result in the imposition of significant fines and penalties and could result in a regulator requiring that we suspend operations in\nthose jurisdictions. In addition to these regulatory concerns, the use of cash with our Mobility products and Delivery offering can\nincrease safety and security risks for Drivers and riders, including potential robbery, assault, violent or fatal attacks, and other criminal\nacts. In certain jurisdictions such as Brazil, serious safety incidents resulting in robberies and violent, fatal attacks on Drivers while\nusing our platform have been reported. If we are not able to adequately address any of these concerns, we could suffer significant\nreputational harm, which could adversely impact our business. Expanding cash payments to additional cities or countries could\namplify these risks.\nIn addition, establishing the proper infrastructure to ensure that we receive the correct service fee on cash trips is complex, and\nhas in the past meant and may continue to mean that we cannot collect the entire service fee for certain of our cash-based trips. We\nhave created systems for Drivers to collect and deposit the cash received for cash-based trips and deliveries, as well as systems for us\nto collect, deposit, and properly account for the cash received, some of which are not always effective, convenient, or widely-adopted\nby Drivers. Creating, maintaining, and improving these systems requires significant effort and resources, and we cannot guarantee\nthese systems will be effective in collecting amounts due to us. Further, operating a business that uses cash raises compliance risks\nwith respect to a variety of rules and regulations, including anti-money laundering laws. If Drivers fail to pay us under the terms of our\nagreements or if our collection systems fail, we may be adversely affected by both the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of\nenforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. Such collection failure and enforcement costs, along with any costs\nassociated with a failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations, could, in the aggregate, impact our financial performance.\nLoss or material modification of our credit card acceptance privileges could have an adverse effect on our business and operating\nresults.\nIn 2024, 62% of our Gross Bookings were paid by either credit card or debit card. As such, the loss of our credit card acceptance\nprivileges would significantly limit our business model. We are required by our payment processors to comply with payment card\nnetwork operating rules, including the Payment Card Industry (“PCI”) and Data Security Standard (the “Standard”). The Standard is a\ncomprehensive set of requirements for enhancing payment account data security developed by the PCI Security Standards Council to\n24",
          "help facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures. Our failure to comply with the Standard and other network\noperating rules could result in fines or restrictions on our ability to accept payment cards. Under certain circumstances specified in the\npayment card network rules, we may be required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments, or other assessments of our\ncompliance with the Standard. Such activities may reveal that we have failed to comply with the Standard. If an audit, self-\nassessment, or other test determines that we need to take steps to remediate any deficiencies, such remediation efforts may distract our\nmanagement team and require us to undertake costly and time consuming remediation efforts. In addition, even if we comply with the\nStandard, there is no assurance that we will be protected from a security breach. Moreover, the payment card networks could adopt\nnew operating rules or interpret existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow, or costly to\nimplement. In addition to violations of network rules, including the Standard, any failure to maintain good relationships with the\npayment card networks could impact our ability to receive incentives from them, could increase our costs, or could otherwise harm our\nbusiness. The loss of our credit card acceptance privileges for any one of these reasons, or the significant modification of the terms\nunder which we obtain credit card acceptance privileges, may have an adverse effect on our business, revenue, and operating results.\nOur platform is highly technical, and any undetected errors could adversely affect our business.\nOur platform is a complex system composed of many interoperating components and incorporates software that is highly\ncomplex. Our business is dependent upon our ability to prevent system interruption on our platform. Our software, including open\nsource software that is incorporated into our code, may now or in the future contain undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some\nerrors in our software code may only be discovered after the code has been released. Bugs in our software, third-party software\nincluding open source software that is incorporated into our code, misconfigurations of our systems, and unintended interactions\nbetween systems could result in our failure to comply with certain federal, state, or foreign reporting obligations, or could cause\ndowntime that would impact the availability of our service to platform users. We have from time to time found defects or errors in our\nsystem and may discover additional defects in the future that could result in platform unavailability or system disruption. In addition,\nwe have experienced outages on our platform due to circumstances within our control, such as outages due to software limitations. We\nrely on co-located data centers for the operation of our platform. If our co-located data centers fail, our platform users may experience\ndown time. If sustained or repeated, any of these outages could reduce the attractiveness of our platform to platform users. In addition,\nour release of new software in the past has inadvertently caused, and may in the future cause, interruptions in the availability or\nfunctionality of our platform. Any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities discovered in our code or systems after release could result in an\ninterruption in the availability of our platform or a negative experience for Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, and\ncould also result in negative publicity and unfavorable media coverage, damage to our reputation, loss of platform users, loss of\nrevenue or liability for damages, regulatory inquiries, or other proceedings, any of which could adversely affect our business and\nfinancial results.\nOur growing use of artificial intelligence and machine learning may present additional risks, including risks associated with\nalgorithm development or use, the tools and data sets used, and/or a complex, developing regulatory environment.\nOur growing use of artificial intelligence (“AI”) (including machine learning) in our business and offerings presents additional\nrisks. This technology presents a number of risks inherent in its use. AI algorithms or automated decision-making or processing of data\nmay be flawed and datasets may be insufficient or contain inaccurate or biased information, which can create inaccurate or\ndiscriminatory outcomes. AI tools and algorithms may use third-party AI with unclear intellectual property rights or interests.\nIntellectual property ownership and license rights, including copyright, of generative and other AI output, have not been fully\ninterpreted by courts or regulations. Europe, the United States and other countries are enacting or may consider comprehensive legal\ncompliance frameworks specifically for AI, which is a trend that may increase now that European lawmakers have passed the first\nsuch framework, the European Artificial Intelligence Act (“AI Act”), which came into effect in August 2024. Further, more specific\nAI-related laws and regulations have been enacted, and are expected to continue to be enacted, around the world. Any failure or\nperceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business. AI use or management by us\nor others, including certain decisions based (whether partially or solely) on automated processing or profiling, inappropriate or\ncontroversial data practices, or insufficient disclosures regarding machine learning and algorithms or AI-generated content, have\nimpaired and could impair the acceptance of AI solutions or subject us to lawsuits, regulatory investigations or other harm, such as\nnegative impacts to the value of our intellectual property or our brand. These and other deficiencies could also undermine the\ndecisions, predictions or analysis AI applications produce, or lead to unintentional bias and discrimination, subjecting us to\ncompetitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm. The rapid evolution of AI may require us to allocate additional\nresources to help implement AI ethically in order to minimize unintended or harmful impacts, and may also require us to make\nadditional investments in the development of proprietary datasets, machine learning models or other systems, which may be costly.\n25",
          "We are subject to climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, our\nbusiness may be adversely impacted.\nWe face climate change-related physical and transition risks, which include risks associated with market shifts toward more\nsustainable or renewable forms of energy and energy conservation. In the context of our business, this includes market shifts toward\nelectric vehicles (“EVs”) and lower carbon business models, and potential increased energy costs. If we fail, or are perceived to fail, to\nkeep up with these market shifts, including changes in consumer preferences and evolving stakeholder expectations, we may lose\ncustomers or face criticism from the media or our stakeholders, and our business, reputation, financial condition and results of\noperations could be adversely affected. Physical climate change risks include risks related to extreme weather events or natural\ndisasters, and include extreme storms and temperatures, flooding, droughts, freezes, wildfires, earthquakes and tsunamis, as well as\nchronic changes such as sea-level rise. Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency, severity and duration of extreme\nweather events and their impact on critical infrastructure in the United States and elsewhere, have the potential to disrupt our business,\nour third-party suppliers, and the business of merchants, Shippers, Carriers and Drivers using our platform, and may cause us to\nexperience higher losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. While we and third parties may take various actions to\nmitigate business risks associated with climate change, this may require incurring substantial costs and may not be successful, due to,\namong other things, the uncertainty associated with the longer-term projections associated with managing climate risks. Additionally,\nwe are or may become subject to emerging environmental and social laws and regulations, including climate policies such as\nCalifornia’s climate-related disclosure legislation (SB 219) and regulations adopted in California in May 2021 requiring 90% of\nvehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to have been in zero emission vehicles by 2030, with interim targets beginning\nin 2023. Certain jurisdictions have also developed and implemented rules to address the environmental impact of rideshare, and\nadditional jurisdictions may consider similar rules and regulations. We are also subject to the Corporate Sustainability Reporting\nDirective, which was adopted in the European Union in December 2022. In addition, Drivers may be subject to climate-related\npolicies that indirectly impact our business, such as the Congestion Charge Zone and Ultra Low Emission Zone schemes adopted in\nLondon that impose fees on drivers in fossil-fueled vehicles, which may impact our ability to attract and maintain Drivers on our\nplatform, and to the extent we experience Driver supply constraints in a given market, we may need to increase Driver incentives.\nAdditional regulations may require us to incur significant additional costs to comply, including increased costs related to\nreporting, the implementation of extensive internal controls processes and procedures regarding matters that have not been subject to\nsuch levels of controls in the past, and impose increased oversight obligations on our management and board of directors, as well as\nrequire us to hire third party experts. Additional regulatory requirements may also end up exposing us to increased activism, litigation\nand enforcement. All of these risks may also impact our suppliers, business partners or customers, which may impact our business,\nfinancial condition, or results of operations.\nIncreased attention to, and evolving expectations regarding sustainability matters may adversely impact our business, reputation\nand liabilities, including in the context of certain goals we have announced.\nCompanies across all industries and around the globe are facing increasing scrutiny relating to their environmental and social\ninitiatives and activities by investors, lenders, regulators, customers, employees and other stakeholders. We have taken, and may\ncontinue to take, certain environmental and social actions, including the establishment of environmental and social goals, including\nthose that relate to climate change matters. The increased focus on environmental and social initiatives and evolving stakeholder\nexpectations may present operational, regulatory, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks and impacts, which could have an\nadverse impact on our business, including on our reputation and stock price. For example, investors and lenders may reconsider their\ncapital investment allocation as a result of their assessment of our environmental and social practices, which may impact our access to\ncapital.\nOur ability to meet our environmental and social goals is dependent on many external factors, including such factors as rapidly\nchanging regulatory developments, governmental or political shifts, policies and related interpretation, action from policymakers and\nthe wider auto industry, advances in technology such as battery storage, industry-wide investment, as well as the availability, cost and\naccessibility of EVs to Drivers, and the availability of critical EV charging infrastructure that can be efficiently accessed by Drivers;\nprogress has been made, but without more aggressive action, we cannot achieve all of our goals. All of our climate change-related\ngoals are intentionally challenging, and are therefore subject to risks, uncertainties, third party information or action, and conditions,\nmany of which are outside of our control. Progressing towards our climate goals requires us to invest significant effort, resources, and\nmanagement time, and circumstances may arise, including those beyond our control, that may require us to revise our timelines and/or\nclimate goals. For example, when we set our 2025 climate goals, we anticipated that strong regulatory measures, alongside sustained\nindustry-wide investment, would support our efforts. While progress has been made, without more aggressive action from\npolicymakers and the wider auto industry, we may not be able to achieve all of our 2025 goals as originally anticipated. There can be\nno assurances that our goals will be achieved in the manner we currently intend or at all, and any failure or perceived failure to meet\nregulatory requirements related to climate change, or to meet our stated climate change goals (or other environmental and social goals)\non the timeframe we announced, or at all, could have an adverse impact on our costs and ability to operate, result in litigation, as well\nas harm our brand, reputation, and consequently, our business.\nIn addition, our climate goals are also subject to certain assumptions, estimations, methodologies, and third-party information that\nwe believed to be reasonable at the time, but which may subsequently be determined to be erroneous, insufficient, incomplete,\n26",
          "inaccurate or otherwise misaligned with stakeholder expectations. Any failure or perceived failure to satisfy evolving stakeholder\nexpectations regarding our climate goals and environmental and social reporting may harm our reputation and impact relationships\nwith certain investors and other stakeholders.\nFurthermore, there are efforts by some stakeholders to reduce or limit companies’ efforts on certain environmental, social and\ngovernance related matters. Both advocates and opponents are increasingly resorting to a range of activism forms, including media\ncampaigns, reputational harm, investigations and litigation, to advance their perspectives. To the extent we are subject to such\nactivism, and we have been in the past, it may require us to incur costs or otherwise adversely impact our business. This and other\nstakeholder expectations will likely lead to increased compliance costs as well as scrutiny that could heighten all of the risks identified\nabove and other similar risks. In addition, negative perception of our environmental and social related initiatives, whether due to\nperceived over- or under-pursuit of such initiatives, may result in issues hiring or retaining employees, as well as potential\ninvestigations, regulatory scrutiny, litigation or other adverse impacts to our business.\nGeneral Economic Risks\nOccurrence of a catastrophic event, including but not limited to disease, a weather event, war, or terrorist attack, could adversely\nimpact our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nOutbreaks of contagious disease and the impact of actions to mitigate such disease or pandemic, have adversely impacted and\ncould in the future adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also face risks related to health\nepidemics, outbreaks of contagious disease, and other adverse health developments. For example, the pandemic and responses thereto\nhad an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, for example, by reducing the demand for our Mobility offerings\nglobally, and affecting travel behavior and demand, as well as impacting Driver supply constraints. As another example, during the\npandemic, to support social distancing, we temporarily suspended our shared rides offering globally.\nWe cannot predict the impact a catastrophic event, including disease, weather event, war or terrorist attack will have on our\nbusiness, end-users’ behaviors, business partners and third-party vendors, and we may be adversely impacted as a result of the adverse\nimpact our business partners and third-party vendors suffer. For example, concerns over the economic impact of the pandemic caused\nextreme volatility in financial markets, which adversely impacted our stock price and our ability to access capital markets, and any\nfuture pandemics or other catastrophic events may have a similar impact. In addition, the broader consequences of conflicts in the\nMiddle East and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which may include additional international sanctions, embargoes, regional\ninstability, and geopolitical shifts, increased tensions between the United States and countries in which we operate, and the extent of\nthe conflict’s effect on the global economy, cannot be predicted. Any of these risks could materially affect our business or the value of\nour assets, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or the trading price of our\ncommon stock. The failure of a bank, or other adverse conditions impacting financial institutions at which we maintain balances,\ncould adversely impact our liquidity and financial performance. There can be no assurance that our deposits in excess of the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation limits will be backstopped by the United States, or that any bank or financial institution with which we\ndo business will be able to obtain needed liquidity from other banks, government institutions or by acquisition in the event of a failure\nor liquidity crisis. To the extent any of the foregoing or other catastrophic event adversely affects our business and financial results, it\nmay also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section. Any of the foregoing factors,\nor other cascading effects that are not foreseeable, could adversely impact our business, financial performance and condition, and\nresults of operations.\nThe impact of economic conditions, including the resulting effect on discretionary consumer spending, may harm our business\nand operating results.\nOur performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending. Some of the\nfactors that have an impact on discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt,\nreductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgage markets, taxation, energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence,\ntariffs, and other macroeconomic factors. A deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions, including slower growth or recession,\ninflation and higher interest rates, changes in labor market dynamics, or decreases in consumer spending power may harm our results\nof operations. For example, inflation has increased and is expected to increase our insurance costs. Consumer preferences tend to shift\nto lower-cost alternatives during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. In such\ncircumstances, consumers may choose to use one of our lower price-point products over a higher Gross Bookings per Trip offering,\nmay choose to forgo our offerings for lower-cost personal vehicle or public transportation alternatives, or may reduce total miles\ntraveled as economic activity decreases. Such a shift in consumer behavior may reduce our network liquidity and may harm our\nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results. Likewise, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, including many\nof the merchants in our network, tend to be more adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. Further,\nbecause spending for food purchases from merchants is generally considered discretionary, any decline in consumer spending may\nhave a disproportionate effect on our Delivery offering. If spending at many of the merchants in our network declines, or if a\nsignificant number of these merchants go out of business, consumers may be less likely to use our products and offerings, which could\nharm our business and operating results. Alternatively, if economic conditions improve, it could lead to Drivers obtaining additional or\nalternative opportunities for work, which could negatively impact the number of Drivers on our platform, and thereby reduce our\n27",
          "network liquidity.\nIncreases in fuel, food, labor, energy, and other costs due to inflation and other factors could adversely affect our operating results.\nFactors such as inflation, increased fuel prices, and increased vehicle purchase, rental, insurance, or maintenance costs, including\nincreased prices of new and used vehicle parts as a result of recent global supply chain challenges, and increased fuel prices as result\nof the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East, have and may continue to increase the costs incurred\nby Drivers and Carriers when providing services on our platform. Similarly, factors such as inflation, increased food costs, increased\nlabor and employee benefit costs, increased rental costs, and increased energy costs may increase merchant operating costs,\nparticularly in certain international markets, such as Egypt. Many of the factors affecting Driver, merchant, and Carrier costs are\nbeyond the control of these parties. In many cases, these increased costs may cause Drivers and Carriers to spend less time providing\nservices on our platform or to seek alternative sources of income. Likewise, these increased costs may cause merchants to pass costs\non to consumers by increasing prices, which would likely cause order volume to decline, may cause merchants to cease operations\naltogether, or may cause Carriers to pass costs on to Shippers, which may cause shipments on our platform to decline. A decreased\nsupply of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, or Carriers on our platform would decrease our network liquidity, which could\nharm our business and operating results.\nDependencies on Third Parties\nThe successful operation of our business depends upon the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other\ninfrastructures that are not under our control.\nOur business depends on the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under our\ncontrol. Disruptions in Internet infrastructure or GPS signals or the failure of telecommunications network operators to provide us\nwith the bandwidth we need to provide our products and offerings have interfered, and could continue to interfere with the speed and\navailability of our platform. If our platform is unavailable when platform users attempt to access it, or if our platform does not load as\nquickly as platform users expect, platform users may not return to our platform as often in the future, or at all, and may use our\ncompetitors’ products or offerings more often. In addition, we have no control over the costs of the services provided by national\ntelecommunications operators. If mobile Internet access fees or other charges to Internet users increase, consumer traffic may\ndecrease, which may in turn cause our revenue to significantly decrease.\nOur business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of mobile communications systems. The occurrence of an\nunanticipated problem, such as a power outage, telecommunications delay or failure, security breach, or computer virus could result in\ndelays or interruptions to our products, offerings, and platform, as well as business interruptions for us and platform users.\nFurthermore, foreign governments may leverage their ability to shut down directed services, and local governments may shut down\nour platform at the routing level. Any of these events could damage our reputation, significantly disrupt our operations, and subject us\nto liability, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. We have invested significant\nresources to develop new products to mitigate the impact of potential interruptions to mobile communications systems, which can be\nused by consumers in territories where mobile communications systems are less efficient. However, these products may ultimately be\nunsuccessful.\nWe rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in certain of\nour products and offerings. If such third parties interfere with the distribution of our products or offerings or with our use of such\nsoftware, our business would be adversely affected.\nOur platform relies on third parties maintaining open marketplaces, including the Apple App Store and Google Play, which make\napplications available for download. We cannot assure you that the marketplaces through which we distribute our platform will\nmaintain their current structures or that such marketplaces will not charge us fees to list our applications for download. For example,\nApple Inc. requires that iOS apps obtain users’ permission to track their activities across third-party apps and websites. If iOS users do\nnot grant us such permission, our ability to target those users for advertisements and to measure the effectiveness of such\nadvertisements may be adversely affected, which could decrease the effectiveness of our advertising, and increase our costs to acquire\nand engage users on our platform. We rely upon certain third parties to provide software for our products and offerings, including\nGoogle Maps for the mapping function that is critical to the functionality of our platform. We do not believe that an alternative\nmapping solution exists that can provide the global functionality that we require to offer our platform in all of the markets in which we\noperate. We do not control all mapping functions employed by our platform or Drivers using our platform, and it is possible that such\nmapping functions may not be reliable. If such third parties cease to provide access to the third-party software that we and Drivers use,\ndo not provide access to such software on terms that we believe to be attractive or reasonable, or do not provide us with the most\ncurrent version of such software, we may be required to seek comparable software from other sources, which may be more expensive\nor inferior, or may not be available at all, any of which would adversely affect our business.\nOur business depends upon the interoperability of our platform across devices, operating systems, and third-party applications that\nwe do not control.\nOne of the most important features of our platform is its broad interoperability with a range of devices, operating systems, and\nthird-party applications. Our platform is accessible from the web and from devices running various operating systems such as iOS and\n28",
          "Android. We depend on the accessibility of our platform across these third-party operating systems and applications that we do not\ncontrol. Moreover, third-party services and products are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to modify our platform to assure\nits compatibility with that of other third parties following development changes. The loss of interoperability, whether due to actions of\nthird parties or otherwise, could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on third parties for elements of the payment processing infrastructure underlying our platform. If these third-party\nelements become unavailable or unavailable on favorable terms, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe convenient payment mechanisms provided by our platform are key factors contributing to the development of our business.\nWe rely on third parties for elements of our payment-processing infrastructure to complete consumer transactions and remit payments\nto Drivers, merchants, and Carriers using our platform, and these third parties may refuse to renew our agreements with them on\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all. If these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us on acceptable\nterms or at all, our business may be disrupted. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we generally pay\ninterchange fees and other processing and gateway fees, and such fees result in significant costs. In addition, online payment providers\nare under continued pressure to pay increased fees to banks to process funds, and there is no assurance that such online payment\nproviders will not pass any increased costs on to merchant partners, including us. If these fees increase over time, our operating costs\nwill increase, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, system failures have at times prevented us from making payments to Drivers in accordance with our typical timelines\nand processes, and have caused substantial Driver dissatisfaction and generated a significant number of Driver complaints. Future\nfailures of the payment processing infrastructure underlying our platform could cause Drivers to lose trust in our payment operations\nand could cause them to instead use our competitors’ platforms. If the quality or convenience of our payment processing infrastructure\ndeclines as a result of these limitations or for any other reason, the attractiveness of our business to Drivers, merchants, and Carriers\ncould be adversely affected. If we are forced to migrate to other third-party payment service providers for any reason, the transition\nwould require significant time and management resources, and may not be as effective, efficient, or well-received by platform users.\nWe currently rely on a small number of third-party service providers to host a significant portion of our platform, and any\ninterruptions or delays in services from these third parties could impair the delivery of our products and offerings and harm our\nbusiness.\nWe use a combination of third-party cloud computing services and co-located data centers in the United States and abroad. We do\nnot control the physical operation of any of the co-located data centers we use or the operations of our third-party service providers.\nThese third-party operations and co-located data centers may experience break-ins, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks,\nsabotage, acts of vandalism, and other misconduct. These facilities may also be vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss,\ntelecommunications failures, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and similar events. Our systems do not provide\ncomplete redundancy of data storage or processing, and as a result, the occurrence of any such event, a decision by our third-party\nservice providers to close our co-located data centers without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems may result in our\ninability to serve data reliably or require us to migrate our data to either a new on-premise data center or cloud computing service.\nThis could be time consuming and costly and may result in the loss of data, any of which could significantly interrupt the provision of\nour products and offerings and harm our reputation and brand. We may not be able to easily switch to another cloud or data center\nprovider in the event of any disruptions or interference to the services we use, and even if we do, other cloud and data center providers\nare subject to the same risks. Additionally, our co-located data center facility agreements are of limited durations, and our co-located\ndata center facilities have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable\nto renew our agreements with these facilities on commercially reasonable terms, we may experience delays in the provision of our\nproducts and offerings until an agreement with another co-located data center is arranged. Interruptions in the delivery of our products\nand offerings may reduce our revenue, cause Drivers, merchants, and Carriers to stop offering their services through our platform, and\nreduce use of our platform by consumers and Shippers. Our business and operating results may be harmed if current and potential\nDrivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers believe our platform is unreliable. In addition, if we are unable to scale our data\nstorage and computational capacity sufficiently or on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to innovate and introduce new\nproducts on our platform may be delayed or compromised, which would have an adverse effect on our growth and business.\nOur use of third-party open source software could adversely affect our ability to offer our products and offerings and subjects us to\npossible litigation.\n29",
          "We use third-party open source software in connection with the development of our platform. From time to time, companies that\nuse third-party open source software have faced claims challenging the use of such open source software and their compliance with\nthe terms of the applicable open source license. We may be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be\nopen source software, or claiming non-compliance with the applicable open source licensing terms. Some open source licenses require\nend-users who distribute or make available across a network software and services that include open source software to make\navailable all or part of such software, which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary code. While we employ\npractices designed to monitor our compliance with the licenses of third-party open source software and protect our valuable\nproprietary source code, we have not run a complete open source license review and may inadvertently use third-party open source\nsoftware in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the applicable terms of such license, including claims for\ninfringement of intellectual property rights or for breach of contract. Furthermore, there is an increasing number of open-source\nsoftware license types, almost none of which have been tested in a court of law, resulting in a dearth of guidance regarding the proper\nlegal interpretation of such licenses. If we were to receive a claim of non-compliance with the terms of any of our open source\nlicenses, we may be required to publicly release certain portions of our proprietary source code or expend substantial time and\nresources to re-engineer some or all of our software.\nIn addition, the use of third-party open source software typically exposes us to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial\nsoftware because open-source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the functionality or origin of the software.\nUse of open source software may also present additional security risks because the public availability of such software may make it\neasier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to compromise our platform. Additionally, because any software source\ncode that we make available under an open source license or that we contribute to existing open source projects becomes publicly\navailable, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in such software source code may be limited or lost entirely, and we\nwould be unable to prevent our competitors or others from using such contributed software source code. Any of the foregoing could be\nharmful to our business, financial condition, or operating results and could help our competitors develop products and offerings that\nare similar to or better than ours.\nFinancing and Transactional Risks\nWe will require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on reasonable\nterms or at all.\nTo continue to effectively compete, we will require additional funds to support the growth of our business and allow us to invest\nin new products, offerings, and markets. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities,\nour existing stockholders may suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue may have rights, preferences, and\nprivileges superior to those of existing stockholders. Certain of our existing debt instruments contain, and any debt financing we\nsecure in the future could contain, restrictive covenants relating to our ability to incur additional indebtedness and other financial and\noperational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital with which to pursue business opportunities. For\nexample, our existing debt instruments contain significant restrictions on our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness. We may\nnot be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on\nterms satisfactory to us when required, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges\nand competition may be significantly limited.\nWe have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in the future incur additional indebtedness. Our payment obligations\nunder such indebtedness may limit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility in\noperating our business.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $9.6 billion aggregate principal amount. In addition, up to\napproximately $128 million of Careem Convertible Notes remain subject to future issuance to Careem stockholders as of\nDecember 31, 2024. Subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing and future indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may incur\nadditional debt, secure existing or future debt, or refinance our debt. In particular, we may need to incur additional debt to finance the\npurchase of autonomous vehicles, and such financing may not be available to us on attractive terms or at all.\nWe may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and principal on our\nindebtedness. Such payments will reduce the funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate\npurposes and limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans, and other\ninvestments, which may in turn limit our ability to implement our business strategy, heighten our vulnerability to downturns in our\nbusiness, the industry, or in the general economy, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the\nindustry, and prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise. We cannot assure you that our business will\ngenerate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future financing will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make\nrequired and timely payments on our indebtedness, or to fund our operations. To date, we have used a substantial amount of cash for\noperating activities, and we cannot assure you when we will begin to generate cash from operating activities in amounts sufficient to\ncover our debt service obligations.\nIn addition, under certain of our existing debt instruments, we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to limitations regarding\nour business and operations, including limitations on incurring additional indebtedness and liens, limitations on certain consolidations,\n30",
          "mergers, and sales of assets, and restrictions on the payment of dividends or distributions. Any debt financing secured by us in the\nfuture could involve additional restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational\nmatters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital to pursue business opportunities, including potential\nacquisitions or divestitures. Any default under our debt arrangements could require that we repay our loans immediately, and may\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing, which in turn may have an adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity.\nIn addition, we are exposed to interest rate risk related to some of our indebtedness, which is discussed in greater detail under the\nsection titled “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Quantitative and Qualitative\nDisclosures About Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk.”\nWe may have exposure to materially greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nThe tax laws applicable to our global business activities are subject to uncertainty and can be interpreted differently by different\ncompanies. For example, we may become subject to sales tax rates in certain jurisdictions that are significantly greater than the rates\nwe currently pay in those jurisdictions. Like many other multinational corporations, we are subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign\njurisdictions and have structured our operations to reduce our effective tax rate. Currently, certain jurisdictions are investigating our\ncompliance with tax rules. If it is determined that we are not compliant with such rules, we could owe additional taxes.\nCertain jurisdictions, including Australia, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the UK and other countries, require that we pay any assessed\ntaxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of tax assessments in those jurisdictions. These amounts could\nmaterially adversely impact our liquidity while those matters are being litigated. This prepayment of contested taxes is referred to as\n“pay-to-play.” Payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes; even when such payments\nare made, we continue to defend our positions vigorously. If we prevail in the proceedings for which a pay-to-play payment was made,\nthe jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest.\nAdditionally, the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate have in the past, and may in the future, examine or\nchallenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our\nfinancial position and operating results. Furthermore, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower\nthan anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher\nstatutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, or changes in tax laws,\nregulations, or accounting principles. We are subject to regular review and audit by both U.S. federal and state tax authorities, as well\nas foreign tax authorities, and currently face numerous audits in the United States and abroad. Any adverse outcome of such reviews\nand audits could have an adverse effect on our financial position and operating results. In addition, the determination of our worldwide\nprovision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by our management, and we have engaged in many\ntransactions for which the ultimate tax determination remains uncertain. The ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts\nrecorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such\ndetermination is made. Our tax positions or tax returns are subject to change, and therefore we cannot accurately predict whether we\nmay incur material additional tax liabilities in the future, which could impact our financial position. In addition, in connection with\nany planned or future acquisitions, we may acquire businesses that have differing licenses and other arrangements that may be\nchallenged by tax authorities for not being at arm’s-length or that are otherwise potentially less tax efficient than our licenses and\narrangements. Any subsequent integration or continued operation of such acquired businesses may result in an increased effective tax\nrate in certain jurisdictions or potential indirect tax costs, which could result in us incurring additional tax liabilities or having to\nestablish a reserve in our consolidated financial statements, and could adversely affect our financial results.\nChanges in global and U.S. tax legislation may adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. We are unable to predict\nwhat other global or U.S. tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effects such future changes would have on our\nbusiness. Any such changes in tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase\nthe estimated tax liability that we have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheet; affect our financial position, future\noperating results, cash flows, and effective tax rates where we have operations; reduce post-tax returns to our stockholders; and\nincrease the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance. We could become subject to new or additional digital services taxes in\none or more jurisdictions where we operate. The governments of countries in which we operate and other governmental bodies could\nmake unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined in their jurisdictions that are contrary to the way in which we have\ninterpreted and historically applied the rules and regulations described above in our income tax returns filed in such jurisdictions. New\nlaws could significantly increase our tax obligations in the countries in which we do business or require us to change the manner in\nwhich we operate our business. As a result of the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, many of these\nchanges to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position, operating\nresults, and cash flows.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $176 million that begin to expire in 2031 and\n$8.2 billion that have an unlimited carryover period. As of December 31, 2024, we had U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards of\n31",
          "$7.5 billion that started expiring in 2024 and $1.6 billion that have an unlimited carryover period. As of December 31, 2024, we had\nforeign net operating loss carryforwards of $759 million that started expiring in 2024 and $19.2 billion that have an unlimited\ncarryover period. Realization of these net operating loss carryforwards depends on our future taxable income, and there is a risk that\nour existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could materially and\nadversely affect our operating results. In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the IRC, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership\nchange,” generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation’s\nability to use its pre-ownership change U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-ownership change U.S. federal tax\nattributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-ownership change income may be limited. Many U.S. states follow similar\nrules for restricting use of tax attributes after an ownership change. We may experience ownership changes in the future because of\nsubsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-ownership change net\noperating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset U.S. federal and state taxable income may be subject to limitations,\nwhich could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nBecause we conduct a significant and may conduct a growing portion of our business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar but\nreport our consolidated financial results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As exchange\nrates vary, revenue, cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, operating expenses, other income and expense, and\nassets and liabilities, when translated, may also vary materially and thus affect our overall financial results. Although we have entered\ninto and may in the future, enter into hedging arrangements to manage foreign currency translation, such activity may not completely\neliminate fluctuations in our operating results due to currency exchange rate changes. Hedging arrangements are inherently risky, and\nwe have limited experience establishing hedging programs, which could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our\nfinancial condition and operating results.\nIf we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could be\nharmed, and any businesses we acquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, agreements to acquire companies,\nform joint ventures, divest portions or aspects of our business, sell minority stakes in portions or aspects of our business, and acquire\ncomplementary companies or technologies. Competition within our industry for acquisitions of businesses, technologies, and assets is\nintense. As such, even if we are able to identify a target for acquisition, we may not be able to complete the acquisition on\ncommercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to receive approval from the applicable competition authorities, or such target\nmay be acquired by another company, including one of our competitors.\nFurther, negotiations for potential acquisitions or other transactions may result in the diversion of our management’s time and\nsignificant out-of-pocket costs. We may expend significant cash or incur substantial debt to finance such acquisitions, and such\nindebtedness may restrict our business or require the use of available cash to make interest and principal payments. In addition, we\nmay finance or otherwise complete acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, which may result in dilution to our\nstockholders, or if such convertible debt securities are not converted, significant cash outlays. If we fail to evaluate and execute\nacquisitions or other strategic transactions successfully or fail to successfully address any of these risks, our business, financial\ncondition, and operating results may be harmed.\nIn addition, any businesses we acquire may not perform as well as we expect. Failure to manage and successfully integrate\nacquired businesses and technologies, including managing internal controls and any privacy, data security or AI risks associated with\nsuch acquisitions, may harm our operating results and expansion prospects. For example, Careem has historically shared certain user\ndata with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We have\nmaintained our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem’s business, and doing so may cause our\nrelationships with government authorities in certain jurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing\nfines or penalties against us. The process of integrating an acquired company, business, or technology or acquired personnel into our\ncompany is subject to various risks and challenges, including:\n• diverting management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration;\n• disrupting our ongoing business operations;\n• platform user acceptance of the acquired company’s offerings;\n• implementing or remediating the controls, procedures, and policies of the acquired company;\n• integrating the acquired business onto our systems and ensuring the acquired business meets our financial reporting\nrequirements and timelines;\n• retaining and integrating acquired employees, including aligning incentives between acquired employees and existing\nemployees, managing cultural differences between acquired businesses and our business, as well as managing costs\nassociated with eliminating redundancies or transferring employees on acceptable terms with minimal business disruption;\n32",
          "• maintaining important business relationships and contracts of the acquired business;\n• integrating the brand identity of an acquired company with our own;\n• integrating companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience;\n• liability for pre-acquisition activities of the acquired company;\n• litigation or other claims or liabilities arising in connection with the acquisition or the acquired company; and\n• impairment charges associated with goodwill, long-lived assets, investments, and other acquired intangible assets.\nWe have in the past and may in the future implement integration structures that do not fully integrate an acquired company’s\noperating functions. Such structures may delay the efficiencies that we expect to gain from the acquisition and our brand and\nreputation could be impacted by any damage or reputational harm to the acquired company’s brand.\nIn addition, our acquisition of Careem has increased our risks under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other\nsimilar laws outside the United States. Our existing and planned safeguards, including training and compliance programs to\ndiscourage corrupt practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be\nheld responsible.\nWe may not receive a favorable return on investment for prior or future business combinations, and we cannot predict whether\nthese transactions will be accretive to the value of our common stock. It is also possible that acquisitions, combinations, divestitures,\njoint ventures, or other strategic transactions we announce could be viewed negatively by the press, investors, platform users, or\nregulators, any or all of which may adversely affect our reputation and our business. Any of these factors may adversely affect our\nability to consummate a transaction, our financial condition, and our operating results.\nWe cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder\nvalue.\nAlthough our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program, the program does not obligate us to repurchase any\nspecific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares of our common stock. The timing, manner, price and amount of any\nrepurchases are determined at the discretion of our management, depending on market conditions and other factors. We cannot\nguarantee that the program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value, and it may not prove to be\nthe best use of our cash. The program could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility, and any announcement of a\ntermination of this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock. In addition, this program will reduce our cash\nreserves.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business\nWe may continue to be blocked from or limited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and\nmay be required to modify our business model in those jurisdictions as a result.\nIn certain jurisdictions, including expansion markets such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, our\nridesharing business model has been blocked, capped, or suspended, or we have been required to change our business model, due\nprimarily to laws and significant regulatory restrictions in such jurisdictions. In some cases, we have applied for and obtained licenses\nor permits to operate and must continue to comply with the license or permit requirements or risk revocation. In addition, we may not\nbe able to maintain or renew any such license or permit. We cannot predict whether future regulatory decisions or legislation in other\njurisdictions may embolden or encourage other authorities to take similar actions even where we are operating according to the terms\nof an existing license or permit.\nTraditional taxicab and car service operators in various jurisdictions in the United States and abroad continue to lobby legislators\nand regulators to block our Mobility products or to require us to comply with regulatory, insurance, record-keeping, licensing, and\nother requirements to which taxicab and car services are subject. For example, in January 2019, we suspended our Mobility products\nin Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could be picked up by\nridesharing drivers; in March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via taxis only. In December 2018, New York City’s Taxi and Limousine\nCommission implemented a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard,\nfor drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform. These minimum rates\ntook effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulations have had an adverse impact on our financial performance in\nNew York City and may continue to do so in the future. In August 2018, the New York City Council voted to approve various\nmeasures to further regulate our business, including driver earning rules, licensing requirements, and a one-year freeze on new for-hire\nvehicle licenses for ridesharing services like those enabled via our platform; the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains.\nAdditionally, in November 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by voters in\nSan Francisco and such surcharge took effect on January 1, 2020. Also in January 2020, a new tax went into effect in Chicago that\nimposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing trip taken in Chicago. In addition, in March 2022, a Washington state bill was signed\ninto law establishing a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform, and other jurisdictions have in the past\nconsidered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for\n33",
          "minimum wages while providing services on our platform. Similar legislative or regulatory initiatives are being considered or have\nbeen enacted in countries outside the United States. If other jurisdictions impose similar regulations, our business growth could be\nadversely affected.\nIn certain jurisdictions, we are subject to national, state, local, or municipal laws and regulations that are ambiguous in their\napplication or enforcement or that we believe are invalid or inapplicable. In such jurisdictions, we may be subject to regulatory fines\nand proceedings and, in certain cases, may be required to cease operations altogether if we continue to operate our business as\ncurrently conducted, unless and until such laws and regulations are reformed to clarify that our business operations are fully compliant\nor such laws and regulations are determined to be invalid or inapplicable. For example, in September 2020, the Hong Kong Court of\nFinal Appeal issued a ruling against a group of drivers who used the Uber app, concluding that by driving for hire without a Hire Car\nPermit, they violated the local Road Traffic Ordinance. A judicial review process is pending. However, these developments may\nadversely affect our ability to offer ridesharing services and negatively impact our financial performance in Hong Kong. As another\nexample, in January 2020, we ceased offering our Mobility products in Colombia after a Colombian court ruled that we violated local\ncompetition laws. In response, we appealed the decision, made certain changes to our Mobility products in Colombia and re-launched\nMobility in Colombia in February 2020, and in June 2020, the Appeals Court of Bogota revoked its order to block Mobility products\nin Colombia. Such decision was confirmed by the Colombia Supreme Court in 2023. Furthermore, in certain of these jurisdictions, we\ncontinue to provide our products and offerings while we assess the applicability of these laws and regulations to our products and\nofferings or while we seek judicial, regulatory or policy changes to address concerns with respect to our ability to comply with these\nlaws and regulations. Our decision to continue operating in these instances has come under investigation or has otherwise been subject\nto scrutiny by government authorities. Our continuation of this practice and other past practices may result in fines or other penalties\nagainst us and Drivers imposed by local regulators, potentially increasing the risk that our licenses or permits that are necessary to\noperate in such jurisdictions will not be renewed. Such fines and penalties have in the past been, and may in the future continue to be,\nimposed solely on Drivers, which may cause Drivers to stop providing services on our platform. In many instances, we make the\nbusiness decision as a gesture of goodwill to pay the fines on behalf of Drivers or to pay Drivers’ defense costs, which, in the\naggregate, can be in the millions of dollars. Furthermore, such business practices may also result in negative press coverage, which\nmay discourage Drivers and consumers from using our platform and could adversely affect our revenue. In addition, we face\nregulatory obstacles, including those lobbied for by our competitors or from local governments globally, that have favored and may\ncontinue to favor local or incumbent competitors, including obstacles for potential Drivers seeking to obtain required licenses or\nvehicle certifications. In addition, an increasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our\nDelivery offering and caps on surge pricing with respect to our Mobility offering. We have incurred, and expect that we will continue\nto incur, significant costs in defending our right to operate in accordance with our business model in many jurisdictions. To the extent\nthat efforts to block or limit our operations are successful, or we or Drivers are required to comply with regulatory and other\nrequirements applicable to taxicab and car services, our revenue and growth would be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future\nprospects.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our platform is available in more than 15,000 cities in over 70 countries. We are subject to differing,\nand sometimes conflicting, laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we provide our offerings. A large number of\nproposals are before various national, regional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in\nforeign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model. Certain proposals, if adopted, could significantly and materially\nharm our business, financial condition, and operating results by restricting or limiting how we operate our business, increasing our\noperating costs, and decreasing our number of platform users. We cannot predict whether or when such proposals may be adopted.\nFurther, existing or new laws and regulations could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to\ncomply with such laws and regulations, and could dampen the growth and usage of our platform. For example, as we expand our\nofferings in new areas, such as non-emergency medical transportation, we may be subject to additional healthcare-related federal and\nstate laws and regulations. Additionally, because our offerings are frequently first-to-market in the jurisdictions in which we operate,\nseveral local jurisdictions have passed, and we expect additional jurisdictions to pass, laws and regulations that limit or block our\nability to offer our products to Drivers and consumers in those jurisdictions, thereby impeding overall use of our platform. We are\nactively challenging some of these laws and regulations and are lobbying other jurisdictions to oppose similar restrictions on our\nbusiness, especially our ridesharing services. Further, because a substantial portion of our business involves vehicles that run on fossil\nfuels, laws, regulations, or governmental actions seeking to curb air pollution or emissions may impact our business. Moreover, in\nMay 2021, California adopted a regulation requiring 90% of vehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to have been in\nEVs by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. Additionally, proposed ridesharing regulations in Egypt and other jurisdictions\nmay require us to share certain personal data with government authorities to operate our app, which we may not be willing to provide.\nOur failure to share such data in accordance with these regulations may result in government authorities assessing significant fines or\npenalties against us or shutting down our or Careem’s app in Egypt on either a temporary or indefinite basis.\nIn addition, we are currently involved in litigation in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We initiated some of these\nlegal challenges to contest the application of certain laws and regulations to our business. Others have been brought by taxicab\nowners, local regulators, local law enforcement, and platform users, including Drivers and consumers. These include individual,\n34",
          "multiple plaintiff, and putative class and class action claims for alleged violation of laws related to, among other things, transportation,\ncompetition, advertising, consumer protection, fee calculations, personal injuries, privacy, intellectual property, product liability,\ndiscrimination, safety, and employment. For example, in May 2019, a class action was filed against us and certain of our subsidiaries\nin the Supreme Court of Victoria, Australia on behalf of participants in the taxi, hire-car, limousine, and charter vehicle industry who\nwere licensed to operate in particular regions of Australia during certain periods between April 2014 and August 2017. The class\naction alleges that we operated unlawfully in such regions during such periods. The court approved the class action settlement with no\nadmission of liability by Uber. In September 2024, a constitutional reform to the judiciary in Mexico was approved; secondary\nregulations are still pending, which are needed to assess the legal impact on our operations in Mexico. These legislative and regulatory\nproceedings, allegations, and lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in\nfinancial damages or penalties, including criminal penalties, incarceration, and sanctions for individuals employed by us or parties\nwith whom we contract, which could harm our ability to operate our business as planned in one or more of the jurisdictions in which\nwe operate, which could adversely affect our business, revenue, and operating results.\nIn addition, while we divested certain assets of our dockless e-bikes and e-scooters business to Lime in May 2020, consumers in\ncertain cities continue to have access to dockless e-bikes and e-scooters through our app. We expect dockless e-bikes and e-scooters to\nsubject us to additional risks distinct from those relating to our other Mobility, Delivery and Freight offerings. For example,\nconsumers using dockless e-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while\nriding in a vehicle, given the less sophisticated, and in some cases absent, passive protection systems on dockless e-bikes and e-\nscooters. The occurrence of real or perceived quality problems or material defects in current or future dockless e-bikes or e-scooters\navailable via our app could result in negative publicity, market withdrawals, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or lawsuits\nfiled against us, particularly if consumers are injured.\nChanges in, or failure to comply with, competition laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating\nresults.\nCompetition authorities closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of\ngovernments are enforcing competition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as\nthe EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularly surrounding issues of pricing parity, earnings parity, price-fixing, and abuse\nof market power. Many of these jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. For\nexample, complaints have been filed in several jurisdictions, including in the United States and Germany, alleging that our business\npractices violate applicable antitrust and/or competition laws. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new requirements or\nrestrictions on our business, other jurisdictions may follow. Further, any new requirements or restrictions, or proposed requirements or\nrestrictions, could result in adverse publicity or fines, whether or not valid or subject to appeal.\nIn addition, governmental agencies and regulators have and may in the future, among other things, prohibit acquisitions,\ndivestitures, or combinations we plan to make, impose significant fines or penalties, require divestiture of certain of our assets, or\nimpose other restrictions that limit or require us to modify our operations, including limitations on our contractual relationships with\nplatform users or restrictions on our pricing models. Such rulings may alter the way in which we do business and, therefore, may\ncontinue to increase our costs or liabilities or reduce demand for our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, or operating results.\nWe expect that antitrust enforcement agencies (including the DOJ and the FTC) will continue to closely scrutinize merger activity,\nwith a particular focus on the technology sector, and there can be no assurance that proposed, completed or future mergers,\nacquisitions and divestitures will not be the subject of an investigation or enforcement action by the DOJ, the FTC or another antitrust\nenforcement agency. Changes in antitrust laws globally, or in their interpretation, administration or enforcement, may limit our future\nacquisitions, divestitures, operations and growth.\nOur business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial\nservices.\nMost jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. Regulators in certain\njurisdictions may determine that certain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtain licenses to\ncontinue to operate in such jurisdictions. For example, our subsidiary in the Netherlands, Uber Payments B.V., is registered and\nauthorized by its competent authority, De Nederlandsche Bank, as an electronic money institution. This authorization permits Uber\nPayments B.V. to provide payment services (including acquiring and executing payment transactions and money remittances, as\nreferred to in the Revised Payment Services Directive (2015/2366/EU)) and to issue electronic money in the Netherlands. In addition,\nUber Payments B.V. has notified De Nederlandsche Bank that it will provide such services on a cross-border passport basis into other\ncountries within the EEA. Uber Payments UK Limited holds a similar license in the United Kingdom issued by the Financial Conduct\nAuthority, as does UBR Pagos México, S.A. de C.V., Institución de Fondos de Pago Electrónico, issued by the Comisión Nacional\nBancaria y de Valores in Mexico. We continue to critically evaluate our options for seeking additional licenses and approvals in\nseveral other jurisdictions to optimize our payment solutions and support the future growth of our business. We could be denied such\nlicenses, have existing licenses revoked, or be required to make significant changes to our business operations before being granted\nsuch licenses. If we are denied payment or other financial licenses or such licenses are revoked, we could be forced to cease or limit\n35",
          "business operations in certain jurisdictions, including in the EEA, and even if we are able to obtain such licenses, we could be subject\nto fines or other enforcement action, or stripped of such licenses, if we are found to violate the requirements of such licenses. In some\ncountries, it is not clear whether we are required to be licensed as a payment services provider. Were local regulators to determine that\nsuch arrangements require us to be so licensed, such regulators may block payments to Drivers, merchants, Shippers or Carriers. Such\nregulatory actions, or the need to obtain regulatory approvals, could impose significant costs and involve substantial delay in payments\nwe make in certain local markets, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nPayments made by platform users with payment instruments or payment accounts issued in jurisdictions such as the EEA, the UK\nand Mexico for services provided through our platform may be subject to Strong Customer Authentication (“SCA”) regulatory\nrequirements. In many cases, SCA will require a platform user to engage in additional steps to authenticate each payment transaction.\nThese additional authentication requirements in the EEA, UK and Mexico or similar requirements, such as tokenization, in other\ncountries may make our platform user experience substantially less convenient, and such loss of convenience could meaningfully\nreduce the frequency with which platform users use our platform or could cause some platform users to stop using our platform\nentirely, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects. Further, as a result of\nimplementing SCA, many payment transactions on our platform may fail to be authenticated due to platform users not completing all\nnecessary authentication steps. Thus, in some cases, we may not receive payment from consumers in advance of paying Drivers for\nservices received by those users. A substantial increase in the frequency with which we make Driver payments without having\nreceived corresponding payments from consumers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and\nprospects.\nIn addition, laws related to money transmission and online payments are evolving, and changes in such laws could affect our\nability to provide payment processing on our platform in the same form and on the same terms as we have historically, or at all. For\nexample, changes to our business in Europe, combined with changes to the EU Payment Services Directive, caused aspects of our\npayment operations in the EEA to fall within the scope of European payments regulation. As a result, one of our subsidiaries, Uber\nPayments B.V., is directly subject to financial services regulations (including those relating to anti-money laundering, terrorist\nfinancing, and sanctioned or prohibited persons) in the Netherlands and in other countries in the EEA where it conducts business.\nEffective July 1, 2020, we transitioned all our payment operations to the Uber Payments B.V. regulated entity in the EEA countries in\nwhich we are required to do so by the European payments regulations.\nIn addition, as we evolve our business or make changes to our business structure, we may be subject to additional laws or\nrequirements related to money transmission, online payments, and financial regulation. These laws govern, among other things, money\ntransmission, prepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfers, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, banking,\nsystemic integrity risk assessments, security of payment processes, and import and export restrictions. Our business operations,\nincluding our payments to Drivers and merchants, may not always comply with these financial laws and regulations. Historical or\nfuture non-compliance with these laws or regulations could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties, forfeiture of\nsignificant assets, or other enforcement actions. Costs associated with fines and enforcement actions, as well as reputational harm,\nchanges in compliance requirements, or limits on our ability to expand our product offerings, could harm our business.\nFurther, our payment system is susceptible to illegal and improper uses, including fraud on our platform such as fraud against us\nor platform users, money laundering, terrorist financing, fraudulent sales of goods or services, and payments to sanctioned parties. We\nhave invested and will need to continue to invest substantial resources to comply with applicable anti-money laundering and sanctions\nlaws, and in certain jurisdictions, such as the EEA, the UK and Mexico to conduct appropriate risk assessments and implement\nappropriate controls as a regulated financial service provider. Government authorities may seek to bring legal action against us if our\npayment system is used for improper or illegal purposes or if our enterprise risk management or controls in certain jurisdictions such\nas the EEA, the UK, and Mexico are not adequately assessed, updated, or implemented, and any such action could result in financial\nor reputational harm to our business.\nWe currently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, other federal, state\nand local government agencies and other foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business.\nWe are the subject of DOJ inquiries and investigations, as well as enforcement inquiries and investigations by other federal, state\nand local government agencies and other regulators abroad. Those inquiries and investigations cover a broad range of matters,\nincluding but not limited to, our business practices, such as fees, driver and courier earnings, consumer pricing, earner benefits, and\nrelated disclosures, policies and practices related to use of our platform by consumers with disabilities, relationships with third parties,\ndata privacy practices, and data privacy and security incidents. These issues may continue to lead to costly and time-consuming\nregulatory investigations and litigation from other government entities, as well as potentially material fines and penalties imposed by\nother U.S. and international regulators. Investigations and enforcement actions from such entities, as well as continued negative\npublicity and an erosion of current and prospective platform users’ trust, could severely disrupt our business. In addition, in March\n2022, Uber Technologies, Inc. and Uber B.V. were each fined €2.12 million by the Italian data protection authority for alleged privacy\nviolations stemming from an investigation conducted in 2018.\nWe are also subject to inquiries and investigations by government agencies related to certain transactions we have entered into in\nthe United States and other countries.\n36",
          "These government inquiries and investigations are time-consuming and require a great deal of financial resources and attention\nfrom us and our senior management. If any of these matters are resolved adversely to us, we may be subject to additional fines,\npenalties, and other sanctions, and could be forced to change our business practices substantially in the relevant jurisdictions. Any\nsuch determinations could also result in significant adverse publicity or additional reputational harm, and could result in or complicate\nother inquiries, investigations, or lawsuits from other regulators in future merger control or conduct investigations. Any of these\ndevelopments could result in material financial damages or operational restrictions, and harm our business.\nWe face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations,\ninquiries, litigation, fines, legislative and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to claims, including civil lawsuits in the United States such as those related to the 2016\nBreach. These and any past or future privacy or security incidents could result in violation of applicable U.S. and international privacy,\ndata protection, and other laws. Such violations subject us to individual or consumer class action litigation as well as governmental\ninvestigations and proceedings by federal, state, and local regulatory entities in the United States and internationally, resulting in\nexposure to material civil or criminal liability. Our data security and privacy practices have been the subject of inquiries from\ngovernment agencies and regulators, not all of which are finally resolved. In April 2018, we entered into an FTC consent decree\npursuant to which we agreed, among other things, to implement a comprehensive privacy program, undergo biennial third-party\nassessments, and not misrepresent how we protect consumer information through 2038. In October 2018, the FTC approved the final\nsettlement, which exposes us to penalties for, amongst other activities, future failure to report security incidents. In November and\nDecember 2018, UK, Dutch and French supervisory authorities imposed fines totaling approximately $1.6 million. We have also\nentered into settlement agreements with numerous state enforcement agencies. For example, in January 2016, we entered into a\nsettlement with the Office of the New York State Attorney General under which we agreed to enhance our data security practices. In\naddition, in September 2018, we entered into stipulated judgments with the state attorneys general of all 50 U.S. states and the District\nof Columbia relating to the 2016 Breach, which involved payment of $148 million and assurances that we would enhance our data\nsecurity and privacy practices. In addition, in March 2022, Uber Technologies, Inc. and Uber B.V. were each fined €2.12 million by\nthe Italian data protection authority for alleged privacy violations stemming from an investigation conducted in 2018. Additionally, in\nJuly 2022, we entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the DOJ concerning its investigation into our handling of the 2016\nBreach. Failure to comply with these and other orders could result in substantial fines, enforcement actions, injunctive relief, and other\npenalties that may be costly or that may impact our business. We may also assume liabilities for breaches experienced by the\ncompanies we acquire as we expand our operations. For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant\nregulatory authorities that it had been subject to a data security incident that allowed access to certain personal information of riders\nand drivers on its platform as of January 14, 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data security\nincidents or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security incident that Careem or we experience, we may face harm to our\nbrand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. If we fail to remediate any data security incident that we experience, we may\nface harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. Our insurance programs may not cover all potential claims to\nwhich we are exposed and may not be adequate to indemnify us for the full extent of our potential liabilities. We may also be impacted\nby privacy or security incidents at third-party service providers. We rely on third-party service providers to host or otherwise process\nsome of our data and that of platform users, and they have experienced, and may again experience, security and privacy incidents. Any\nfailure by such third party to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access to, or use, acquisition, disclosure, alteration, or\ndestruction of, such data could have similar adverse consequences for us.\nThis risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions with stringent privacy laws and, as we expand our products, offerings, and operations\ndomestically and internationally, we have been, and may continue to become subject to amended or additional laws that impose\nsubstantial additional obligations related to data privacy and security. The EU adopted the GDPR in 2016, and it became effective in\nMay 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data.\nSuch requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use of personal data,\nstrengthened individual data rights, data breach requirements, limitations on data retention, strengthened requirements for special\ncategories of personal data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, and additional obligations for contracting with service providers\nthat may process personal data. In addition, the GDPR contains a provision that individuals shall have the right not to be subject to a\ndecision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning them or similarly\nsignificantly affects them. Decisions based on AI or on automated processing of data, or insufficient disclosures regarding this\nprocessing, have and could impair our business and have and could subject us to lawsuits, regulatory investigations or other harm. The\nGDPR further provides that EU member states may institute additional laws and regulations impacting the processing of personal data,\nincluding (i) special categories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs)\nand (ii) certain decisions based solely on automated processing, including profiling. Such additional laws and regulations could limit\nour ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs and harming our business and financial condition. Non-\ncompliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significant penalties, including\nfines of up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data.\nOther jurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations,\nincluding for automated processing, decision making, and profiling, which will increase our compliance costs and the risks associated\nwith non-compliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which provided new privacy rights for\n37",
          "consumers and new operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA includes a statutory damages\nframework and private rights of action against businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable\nsecurity procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Other U.S. states have adopted, and likely will continue to adopt, similar\nlaws that provide new consumer privacy rights and business operational requirements. Brazil provides another example, having passed\nthe General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais, or LGPD) in 2018, which is now in effect. These laws\nmay be subject to amendments and regulations that may change over time, or result in additional follow-on laws such as the California\nPrivacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) passed in California in November 2020. For further information on risks related to our use of certain\ndecisions based solely on automated processing or profiling, see the risk factor titled “—Our growing use of artificial intelligence and\nmachine learning may present additional risks, including risks associated with algorithm development or use, the tools and data sets\nused, and/or a complex, developing regulatory environment.”\nAdditionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws\nrelating to transfer of personal data outside the EEA. We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws. Such mechanisms\nhave received heightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny and have undergone modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of\nJustice of the European Union had cast doubt on the adequacy of all of the formerly-approved mechanisms for transferring personal\ndata from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States. While in July 2023 the European Commission\ndeemed a new EU-US Data Privacy Framework adequate for personal data transfers from the EU (and the rest of the EEA) to the\nUnited States, this Framework has been challenged. If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the\nEEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to transfer personal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in\nthose regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results, and has resulted in and\nmay result in substantial fines, enforcement actions, litigation, injunctive relief, and other penalties that may be costly or that may\nimpact our business. In addition, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies,\nincluding from state and city regulators as a requirement for obtaining or maintaining a license or otherwise, from law enforcement\nagencies, and from intelligence agencies. This disclosure or potential disclosure may result in a failure or perceived failure by us to\ncomply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, and regulations, could result in proceedings or actions against us\nin the same or other jurisdictions, and could have an adverse impact on our reputation and brand. In addition, Careem has historically\nshared certain user data with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and\nownership. We expect to maintain our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem’s business, and\ndoing so may cause our relationship with government authorities in certain jurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such government\nauthorities assessing fines or penalties against us. Further, if any jurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or\nregulations relating to data residency or local computation such that we are unable to comply in a timely manner or at all, we may risk\nlosing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. This could adversely affect the manner in which we provide our products and\nofferings and thus materially affect our operations and financial results.\nSuch data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation\nand enforcement, and thus compliance requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent. This includes, for example,\nthose relating to the processing of data for purposes of advertising and profile creation, which are subject to evolving disclosure,\nchoice, and consent requirements in the EU, United States, and other jurisdictions. Compliance with such laws may require changes to\nour data collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing and certain other related business practices and may thereby increase\ncompliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our operations. Additionally, any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with\nprivacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, orders and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by\nindividuals, consumer rights groups, governmental entities or agencies, or others. We could incur significant costs investigating and\ndefending such claims and, if found liable, significant damages. Further, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may\nsubject us to significant penalties and negative publicity. If any of these events were to occur, our business and financial results could\nbe significantly disrupted and adversely affected.\n38",
          "Adverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved could expose us to\nmonetary damages or limit our ability to operate our business.\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future become, involved in private actions, collective actions,\ninvestigations, and various other legal proceedings by Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, Carriers, employees, commercial\npartners, competitors or, government agencies, among others. We are currently party to various legal and regulatory matters that have\narisen in the normal course of business and include, among others, alleged independent contractor misclassification claims, Fair Credit\nReporting Act (“FCRA”) claims, alleged background check violations, pricing and advertising claims, unfair competition claims,\nintellectual property claims, employment discrimination and other employment-related claims, Americans with Disabilities Act\n(“ADA”) claims, data and privacy claims, securities claims, antitrust claims, personal injury claims, challenges to regulations, and\nother matters. The results of any such litigation, investigations, and legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and expensive. Any\nclaims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, costly, and harmful to our reputation, and could require\nsignificant amounts of management time and corporate resources. If any of these legal proceedings were to be determined adversely to\nus, or we were to enter into a settlement, we could be exposed to monetary damages or be forced to change the way in which we\noperate our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, we regularly include arbitration provisions in our terms of service with end-users. These provisions are intended to\nstreamline the litigation process for all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating\ndisputes in state or federal court. However, arbitration may become more costly for us, or the volume of arbitrations may increase and\nbecome burdensome. Further, the use of arbitration provisions may subject us to certain risks to our reputation and brand, as these\nprovisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. To minimize these risks, we have in the past and may in the future\nvoluntarily limit our use of arbitration provisions, or we may be required to do so, in any legal or regulatory proceeding, either of\nwhich could increase our litigation costs and exposure in respect of such proceedings. For example, effective May 15, 2018, we ended\nmandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct claims by platform users and employees.\nFurther, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, as\nwell as conflicting rules between state and federal law, some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may\nneed to be revised to exempt certain categories of protection. If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole\nor in part, or specific claims were required to be exempted from arbitration, we could experience an increase in our litigation costs and\nthe time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly lawsuits, each of which could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\nWe have operations in countries known to experience high levels of corruption and were previously subject to, and may in the\nfuture be subject to, inquiries, investigations, and requests for information with respect to our compliance with a number of anti-\ncorruption laws to which we are subject.\nWe have operations in, and have business relationships with, entities in countries known to experience high levels of corruption.\nWe are subject to the FCPA and other similar laws outside the United States that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to\nforeign officials, foreign political parties, or candidates for foreign political office for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.\nU.S. and non-U.S. regulators alike continue to focus on the enforcement of these laws, and we may be subject to additional\ncompliance requirements to identify criminal activity and payments to sanctioned parties. Our activities in certain countries with high\nlevels of corruption enhance the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers or\nCarriers, employees, consultants, or business partners in violation of various anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, even though\nthe actions of these parties are often outside our control. Our acquisition of Careem may further enhance this risk because users of\nCareem’s platform and Careem’s employees, consultants, and business partners may not be familiar with, and may not have been\npreviously subject to, these anti-corruption laws. In addition, our existing and future safeguards, including training and compliance\nprograms to discourage these practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we\ncould be held responsible. Additional compliance requirements may compel us to revise or expand our compliance program, including\nthe procedures we use to verify the identity of platform users and monitor international and domestic transactions.\n39",
          "Drivers may become subject to increased licensing requirements, and we may be required to obtain additional licenses or cap the\nnumber of Drivers using our platform.\nMany Drivers currently are not required to obtain a commercial taxi or livery license in their respective jurisdictions. However,\nnumerous jurisdictions in which we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including\nmarkets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and\nAfrica, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to be licensed with local authorities or require us or our\nsubsidiaries to be licensed as a transportation company. Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Drivers may adversely affect\nour ability to scale our business and operations. In addition, it is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number of\nlicensed Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work,\nsimilar to recent regulations that were adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for\nDrivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers become subject to such caps, limitations, or licensing requirements, our business\nand growth prospects would be adversely impacted.\nWe may be subject to liability for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers.\nWe operate in an industry in which the competition for Drivers is intense. In this highly competitive environment, the means we\nuse to onboard and attract Drivers may be challenged by competitors, government regulators, or individual plaintiffs. For example,\nputative class actions have been filed by individual plaintiffs against us for alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection\nAct of 1991, alleging, among other things, that plaintiffs received text messages from us regarding our Driver program without their\nconsent or after indicating to us they no longer wished to receive such text messages. These lawsuits are expensive and time\nconsuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in material financial damages and penalties, costly adjustments to\nour business practices, and negative publicity. In addition, we could incur substantial expense and possible loss of revenue if\ncompetitors file additional lawsuits or other claims challenging these practices.\nOur business depends heavily on insurance coverage for Drivers and on other types of insurance for additional risks related to our\nbusiness. If insurance carriers change the terms of such insurance in a manner not favorable to Drivers or to us, if we are\nrequired to purchase additional insurance for other aspects of our business, or if we fail to comply with regulations governing\ninsurance coverage, our business could be harmed.\nWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance\nsubsidiary. Insurance related to our Mobility products may include third-party automobile, automobile comprehensive and collision,\nphysical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage. We require Drivers to carry automobile insurance in most\ncountries, and in many cases we also maintain insurance on behalf of Drivers. We rely on a limited number of ridesharing insurance\nproviders, and should such providers discontinue or increase the cost of coverage, we cannot guarantee that we would be able to\nsecure replacement coverage on reasonable terms or at all. In addition to insurance related to our products, we maintain other\nautomobile insurance coverage for owned vehicles and employee activity, as well as insurance coverage for non-automotive corporate\nrisks including general liability, workers’ compensation, property, cyber liability, and director and officers’ liability. If our insurance\ncarriers change the terms of our policies in a manner unfavorable to us or Drivers, our insurance costs could increase. The cost of\ninsurance that we maintain on behalf of Drivers is higher in the United States and Canada than in other geographies. Further, if the\ninsurance coverage we maintain is not adequate to cover losses that occur, we could be liable for significant additional costs.\nIn addition, we and our captive insurance subsidiary are party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that\ntransfer a significant portion of the risk from the insurance provider to us or our captive insurance subsidiary, which could require us\nto pay out material amounts that may be in excess of our insurance reserves, including as a result of adverse legal proceedings,\nresulting in harm to our financial condition. Our insurance reserves include amounts for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses\nfor risks retained by us through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms. Such amounts are based on\nactuarial estimates, historical claim information, and industry data. While management believes that these reserve amounts are\nadequate, the ultimate liability could be in excess of our reserves. Insurance recoverables are recognized when we enter into contracts\nthat transfer the risk recorded in our insurance reserves to third-party insurance companies. We also have requirements to post\ncollateral for current and future claim settlement obligations with certain of our insurance carriers, which may have a significant\nimpact on our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available for general business purposes.\nWe may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have\nbeen caused by Drivers who use our platform, even when those Drivers are not actively using our platform or when an individual\nimpersonates a Driver, by consumers using our services, or by third parties. As we expand to include more offerings on our platform,\nour insurance needs will likely extend to those additional offerings, including Freight. As a result, our automobile liability and general\nliability insurance policies and insurance maintained by Drivers may not cover all potential claims related to traffic accidents, injuries,\nor other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers who use our platform or where liability is otherwise alleged against\nus, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that we could face. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we could\nincur significant costs in investigating and defending against them. If insurers become insolvent, they may not be able to pay\notherwise valid claims in a timely manner or at all. If we are subject to claims of liability relating to the acts of Drivers or others using\nour platform, we may be subject to negative publicity and incur additional expenses, which could harm our business, financial\n40",
          "condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, we are subject to local laws, rules, and regulations relating to insurance coverage which could result in proceedings or\nactions against us by governmental entities or others. Legislation has been passed in many U.S. jurisdictions that codifies these\ninsurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Additional legislation has been proposed in other jurisdictions that seeks to codify\nor change insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Further, service providers and business customers of Freight and Uber\nfor Business may require higher levels of coverage as a condition to entering into certain key contracts with us. Any failure, or\nperceived failure, by us to comply with local laws, rules, and regulations or contractual obligations relating to insurance coverage\ncould result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. These lawsuits, proceedings, or actions may\nsubject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, require us to increase our insurance coverage, require us to amend our\ninsurance policy disclosure, increase our costs, and disrupt our business.\nWe may be subject to pricing regulations, as well as related litigation or regulatory inquiries.\nOur revenue is dependent on the pricing models we use to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings. Our pricing models,\nincluding dynamic pricing, have been, and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in\ncertain jurisdictions. For example, we have agreed to not calculate consumer fares in excess of the maximum government-mandated\nfares in all major Indian cities where legal proceedings have limited the use of surge pricing. Further, in 2018, Honolulu, Hawaii\nbecame the first U.S. city to pass legislation to cap surge pricing if increased rates exceed the maximum fare set by the city. Additional\nregulation of our pricing models could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, our pricing model\nhas been the subject of litigation and regulatory inquiries related to, among other things, the calculation of and statements regarding\nconsumer fares and Driver earnings (including rates, fees, surcharges, and tolls), as well as the use of surge pricing during emergencies\nand natural disasters. In addition, an increasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our\nDelivery offering and caps on surge pricing with respect to our Mobility offering. As a result, we may be forced to change our pricing\nmodels in certain jurisdictions, which could harm our revenue or result in a sub-optimal tax structure.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the\nintellectual property of others, we may incur significant expense and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur intellectual property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code,\nfirmware, hardware and hardware designs, registered and unregistered trademarks, trademark applications, copyrights, trade secrets,\ninventions (whether or not patentable), patents, and patent applications. We believe that our intellectual property is essential to our\nbusiness and affords us a competitive advantage in the markets in which we operate. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual\nproperty, our brand and reputation may be harmed, Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers could devalue our products\nand offerings, and our ability to compete effectively may be impaired.\nTo protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual\nprovisions, end-user policies, and disclosure restrictions. Upon discovery of potential infringement of our intellectual property, we\nassess and when necessary, take action to protect our rights as appropriate. We also enter into confidentiality agreements and invention\nassignment agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary\ninformation in a commercially prudent manner. The efforts we have taken and may take to protect our intellectual property may not be\nsufficient or effective. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we\ncurrently or in the future will operate. In addition, it may be possible for other parties to copy or reverse-engineer our products and\nofferings or obtain and use the content of our website without authorization. Further, we may be unable to prevent competitors or other\nthird parties from acquiring or using domain names or trademarks that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our\ndomain names, trademarks, service marks, and other proprietary rights. Moreover, our trade secrets may be compromised by third\nparties or our employees, which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage derived from the compromised trade secrets.\nFurther, we may be unable to detect infringement of our intellectual property rights, and even if we detect such violations and decide\nto enforce our intellectual property rights, we may not be successful, and may incur significant expenses, in such efforts. In addition,\nany such enforcement efforts may be time-consuming and may divert management’s attention. Further, such enforcement efforts may\nresult in a ruling that our intellectual property rights are unenforceable or invalid. Any failure to protect or any loss of our intellectual\nproperty may have an adverse effect on our ability to compete and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating\nresults.\nCompanies in the Internet and technology industries, and other patent and trademark holders, including “non-practicing entities,”\nseeking to profit from royalties in connection with grants of licenses or seeking to obtain injunctions, own large numbers of patents,\ncopyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of\nintellectual property rights. We have and may in the future continue to receive notices that claim we have misappropriated, misused, or\ninfringed upon other parties’ intellectual property rights.\nFurthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products, including in areas in which we historically have not\noperated, which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims. In addition, we, and companies we\nacquired or in which we have an interest, have been sued, and may in the future be sued, for allegations of intellectual property\ninfringement or threats of trade secret misappropriation. If a company we acquire or in which we have an interest loses rights to\n41",
          "valuable intellectual property or is found to infringe third party intellectual property rights in such lawsuits, the value of our\ninvestment may materially decline.\nAny intellectual property claim against us, regardless of merit, could be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate, could\ndivert our management’s attention and other resources, and could hurt goodwill associated with our brand. These claims may also\nsubject us to significant liability for damages and may result in us having to stop using technology, content, branding, or business\nmethods found to be in violation of another party’s rights. Further, certain adverse outcomes of such proceedings could adversely\naffect our ability to compete effectively in existing or future businesses.\nWe may be required or may opt to seek a license for the right to use intellectual property held by others, which may not be\navailable on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if a license is available, we may be required to pay significant royalties or\nlicense fees, which may increase our operating expenses. We may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology,\ncontent, branding, or business methods, which could require significant effort and expense and make us less competitive. If we cannot\nlicense or develop alternative technology, content, branding, or business methods for any allegedly infringing aspect of our business,\nwe may be unable to compete effectively or we may be prevented from operating our business in certain jurisdictions. Any of these\nresults could harm our operating results.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles.\nThe accounting for our business is complicated, particularly in the area of revenue recognition, and is subject to change based on\nthe evolution of our business model, interpretations of relevant accounting principles, enforcement of existing or new regulations, and\nchanges in SEC or other agency policies, rules, regulations, and interpretations, of accounting regulations. Changes to our business\nmodel and accounting methods could result in changes to our financial statements, including changes in revenue and expenses in any\nperiod, or in certain categories of revenue and expenses moving to different periods, may result in materially different financial results,\nand may require that we change how we process, analyze, and report financial information and our financial reporting controls.\nIf we are deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act, applicable restrictions could have an adverse effect\non our business.\nThe Investment Company Act contains substantive legal requirements that regulate the manner in which “investment companies”\nare permitted to conduct their business activities. We believe that we have conducted our business in a manner that does not result in\nbeing characterized as an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act because we are primarily engaged in a non-\ninvestment company business. Although a significant portion of our assets constitute investments in non-controlled entities (including\nin China), referred to elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as minority-owned entities, we believe that we are not an\ninvestment company as defined by the Investment Company Act. While we intend to conduct our operations such that we will not be\ndeemed an investment company, such a determination would require us to initiate burdensome compliance requirements and comply\nwith restrictions imposed by the Investment Company Act that would limit our activities, including limitations on our capital structure\nand our ability to transact with subsidiaries and other entities, which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition. To avoid\nsuch a determination, we may be required to conduct our business in a manner that does not subject us to the requirements of the\nInvestment Company Act, which could have an adverse effect on our business. For example, we may be required to sell certain of our\nassets and pay significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of such assets.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile or may decline steeply or suddenly regardless of\nour operating performance, and we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations. You may not be able to resell your\nshares at or above the price you paid and may lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate or decline significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are\nbeyond our control, including:\n• actual or anticipated fluctuations in MAPCs, Trips, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Gross Bookings, revenue, or\nother operating and financial results;\n• announcements by us or estimates by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the number of Drivers and\nconsumers on our platform;\n• variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of our management, securities analysts, investors, the\nfinancial community;\n• changes in accounting principles or changes in interpretations of existing principles, which could affect financial results;\n• actions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities\nanalysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n• announcements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic\npartnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n42",
          "• negative media coverage or publicity;\n• changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of technology companies generally, or those in our\nindustry in particular, including our competitors;\n• price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n• lawsuits threatened, filed, or decided against us;\n• developments in legislation or regulatory actions, including interim or final rulings by judicial or regulatory bodies\n(including any competition authorities blocking, delaying, or subjecting our pending acquisitions to significant limitations\nor restrictions on our ability to operate in one or more markets, or requiring us to divest our or any target company’s assets\nor businesses in one or more markets);\n• changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\n• any major change in our board of directors or management;\n• any safety incidents or public reports of safety incidents that occur on our platform or in our industry;\n• statements, commentary, or opinions by public officials that our product offerings are or may be unlawful, regardless of\nany interim or final rulings by judicial or regulatory bodies;\n• any trading activity in our share repurchase program; and\n• other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, public health concerns\nor epidemics, pandemics, natural disasters, or responses to these events.\nIn addition, price and volume fluctuations in the stock markets have affected and continue to affect many technology companies’\nstock prices. Often, their stock prices have fluctuated in ways unrelated or disproportionate to the companies’ operating performance.\nIn the past, stockholders have filed securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. For example, beginning in\nSeptember 2019, several putative class actions were filed in California state and federal courts against us, our directors, certain of our\nofficers, and the underwriters named in our IPO registration statement alleging violations of securities laws in connection with our\nIPO. Securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and\nseriously harm our business. In addition, the occurrence of any of the factors listed above, among others, may cause our stock price to\ndecline significantly, and there can be no assurance that our stock price would recover. As such, you may not be able to sell your\nshares at or above the price you paid, and you may lose some or all of your investment.\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could\nmake a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress the\ntrading price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our\nmanagement that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions include the following:\n• our board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill vacancies created by the expansion of our board of directors or\nthe resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board\nof directors;\n• advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals, which may reduce the number of stockholder proposals available\nfor stockholder consideration;\n• limitations on stockholder ability to convene special stockholder meetings, which could make it difficult for our\nstockholders to adopt desired governance changes;\n• prohibition on cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect\ndirector candidates; and\n• our board of directors is able to issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock, which makes\nit possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede\nthe success of any attempt to acquire us.\nAny provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws, or Delaware law that has\nthe effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their\nshares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. In addition,\nunder our existing debt instruments, we, and certain of our subsidiaries, are subject to certain limitations on our business and\noperations, including limitations on certain consolidations, mergers, and sales of assets. For information regarding these and other\nprovisions, see the risk factor titled “—We have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in the future incur additional\nindebtedness. Our payment obligations under such indebtedness may limit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt\n43",
          "agreements may restrict our flexibility in operating our business.”\nSales, directly or indirectly, of shares of our common stock by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nSales, directly or indirectly, of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the public perception that these sales might\noccur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional\nequity securities. We may issue our shares of common stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for our\ncommon stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investments or otherwise. Such issuances, including the\nissuance of additional shares of our common stock upon exercise of equity awards or conversion of our convertible notes, could result\nin substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance\nthe operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In\naddition, certain of our existing debt instruments include restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends. As a result, you may only\nreceive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and, to the\nextent enforceable, the federal district courts of the United States of America are the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes\nbetween us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with\nus or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the\nexclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:\n• any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n• any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;\n• any action asserting a claim against us or our directors, officers, or employees arising under the Delaware General\nCorporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws;\n• any action regarding our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws;\n• any action as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State\nof Delaware; and\n• any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal-affairs doctrine.\nThis provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for\nwhich the U.S. federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will\nbe the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, subject to and\ncontingent upon a final adjudication in the State of Delaware of the enforceability of such exclusive forum provision. Although the\nDelaware Supreme Court has held that such exclusive forum provisions are facially valid, courts in other jurisdictions may find such\nprovisions to be unenforceable.\nThese exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for\ndisputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers,\nand other employees. If any other court of competent jurisdiction were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and\nrestated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the\ndispute in other jurisdictions, which could seriously harm our business.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, investors may lose confidence in the\naccuracy and completeness of our financial reports, and the market price of our common stock may be harmed.\nAs a result of being a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal controls over\nfinancial reporting, and any failure to maintain the adequacy of these internal controls may adversely affect investor confidence in our\ncompany and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“Section 404”), to furnish an annual report by management\non, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public\naccounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial annually. We currently are required to\ndisclose changes in internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,\nour internal control over financial reporting on a quarterly basis.\nThe process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with\n44",
          "Section 404 is costly and challenging, and we may not be able to complete evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in a\ntimely fashion. As our business continues to grow in size and complexity, we are improving our processes and infrastructure to help\nensure we can prepare financial reporting and disclosures within the timeline required for a public company. During the evaluation and\ntesting process of our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting,\nwe will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nWe cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future,\nwhich may cause challenges in consistent performance and timely designing new controls. Any failure to maintain internal control\nover financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition or operating results. If we are\nunable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if we or our independent registered public\naccounting firm determines we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor\nconfidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we\ncould be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC or other regulatory\nauthorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain these\nand other effective control systems, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNot applicable.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nSafeguarding our critical networks and the information that platform users share with us is vital to our business. One key way that\nUber addresses this need is through its cybersecurity program, which includes a cybersecurity risk management program.\nUber’s Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) is responsible for the cybersecurity program, which is coordinated and\nprimarily executed by the global organization of engineers focused on risk management using the NIST Framework (Govern, Identify,\nProtect, Detect, Respond, and Recover) and activities such as automation, secure development, and advanced analytics and\nmonitoring. The CISO has served in such role since February 2021 and has more than 20+ years of engineering and/or cybersecurity\nexperience, including previously as CISO and Deputy Chief Technology Officer at a Fortune 500 company.\nThe cybersecurity program is also supported by Uber’s Chief Privacy Officer and Associate General Counsel, Privacy &\nCybersecurity (“CPO”), who has served in that role since August 2018. The CPO has over three decades of experience as a legal\nadvisor to multinational corporations, including serving as Chief Privacy & Security Counsel for a Fortune 100 technology company\nprior to her role at Uber.\nThe cybersecurity program is supported by other members of Uber’s senior management team as well, including the Chief Legal\nOfficer, Chief Architect Officer, and Global Data Protection Officer. Uber’s Board of Directors oversees the cybersecurity program\nthrough regular updates.\nThis cybersecurity program is a critical component of Uber’s enterprise risk management program, through which Uber reviews\nbusiness, cybersecurity, information technology, privacy, legal, and geopolitical risks, among others. The cybersecurity program is\ndesigned to assess, identify, and manage risks from cybersecurity threats.\nKey elements of this program include:\n• Oversight and Governance. Uber’s Board oversees the cybersecurity program, and Uber’s risk profile with respect to\ncybersecurity matters, through regular reports and reviews. These include presentations by the CISO to the Board and\nAudit Committee on an alternating quarterly basis, quarterly reports of certain cybersecurity incidents to the Board, and\nannual reports by the CPO to the Board.\nThe CISO also provides quarterly updates to Uber’s senior management regarding cybersecurity risks, as well as interim\nupdates during regular meetings with Uber’s engineering, product and internal audit leadership. The CISO and CPO also\njointly chair Uber’s Privacy and Cybersecurity Council, which provides a venue for cross-functional insight and input into\nthe cybersecurity program and our privacy program as they relate to Uber’s business operations.\n• Internally conducted environment and vulnerability assessments. These include regular assessments performed by\nUber’s security engineering teams. The findings from these assessments are reported to Uber’s senior management,\nincluding the CISO, and the Board or Audit Committee. In addition, our internal audit function periodically conducts\nadditional reviews and assessments, which are reported to the Audit Committee. We also conduct table-top exercises to\nsimulate the response to cybersecurity incidents; participants may include, among others, the CISO, the CPO, and\nrepresentatives from communications, investor relations, finance and legal.\n• Independent third-party audits and assessments by industry-leading firms. As a global organization, Uber undergoes\nannual audits to maintain its certification as a Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS 4.0) Level 1\nMerchant and Service provider. Uber also undergoes annual audits to maintain its ISO 27001 certification for its core\nmobility, delivery, and enterprise businesses, and SOC 2 attestations that vary depending on the Uber product.\n45",
          "• Cyber incident management. This includes efforts by Uber’s security engineering team, at the direction of the CISO, to\nreview potential incidents identified by Uber’s internal teams, Uber’s third-party service providers or external researchers\nthrough Uber’s Bug Bounty program; identify those which represent potential or actual threats to Uber’s systems, data or\nusers; investigate and mitigate the cause and impact of such incidents; and implement safeguards to help prevent\nrecurrence. Uber’s CPO and legal team support such efforts, including in connection with legal or disclosure obligations\ntriggered in connection with any such incidents.\n• Third Party Risk Management. Uber performs due diligence regarding its third-party suppliers, service providers and\nbusiness partners. This includes requiring submission of evidence demonstrating third parties’ ability to meet Uber’s\ncybersecurity and data handling requirements. In addition, Uber’s third-party suppliers and service providers who process\nUber personal data are contractually obligated to notify Uber if they experience certain incidents impacting Uber personal\ndata.\nFor a discussion regarding risks from cybersecurity threats, see our risk factors, including the risk factors titled “—We have\nexperienced, and may experience security or privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, disclosure of,\nalteration of or destruction of our proprietary or confidential data, employee data, or platform user data, which could cause loss of\nrevenue, harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities”, “—Cyberattacks, including computer malware,\nransomware, viruses, denial of service attacks, spamming, phishing and social engineering attacks could harm our reputation,\nbusiness, and operating results”, “—We currently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for information\nfrom the DOJ, other federal, state and local government agencies and other foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes of\nwhich could harm our business” and “—We face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data,\nwhich could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy\nand data protection practices” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nAs of December 31, 2024, we leased and owned office facilities around the world totaling 8.8 million square feet, including 2.1\nmillion square feet for our corporate headquarters in the San Francisco Bay Area, California.\nWe believe our facilities, which are generally used by all of our reportable segments, are adequate and suitable for our current\nneeds and that should it be needed, suitable additional or alternative space will be available to accommodate our operations.\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nWe are a party to various legal actions and government investigations, and similar or other actions could be brought against us in\nthe future. The most significant of these matters are described below.\nLegal Proceedings Described in Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies to Our Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 14 – Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024\ncontained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K includes information on legal proceedings that constitute material contingencies for\nfinancial reporting purposes that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of\noperations if they were resolved in a manner that is adverse to us. This item should be read in conjunction with Note 14 for\ninformation regarding the following material legal proceedings, which information is incorporated into this item by reference:\n• Driver Classification\n• State Unemployment Taxes\nLegal Proceedings That Are Not Described in Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies to Our Consolidated Financial\nStatements\nIn addition to the matters that are identified in Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial\nstatements for the year ended December 31, 2024 contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and incorporated into this item by\nreference, the following matters also constitute material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary course litigation incidental to\nour business, to which we are or any of our subsidiaries is a party.\nAustralia Class Actions\nIn May 2019, an Australian law firm filed a class action in the Supreme Court of Victoria, Australia, against us and certain of our\nsubsidiaries, on behalf of certain participants in the taxi, hire-car, and limousine industries. The plaintiff alleges that the Uber entities\nconspired to injure the group members during the period 2014 to 2017 by either directly breaching transport legislation or\ncommissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Drivers in Australia. The claim alleges, in effect, that these operations\ncaused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value of certain taxi\nlicenses. In March, April and October 2020, the same Australian law firm filed four additional class action lawsuits alleging the same\nclaim. In December 2024, the Supreme Court of Victoria approved a settlement with no admission of liability by Uber. The approval is\nsubject to any appeals and the approval of the Supreme Court of Western Australia.\n46",
          "Other Legal Proceedings\nWhile it is not possible to determine the outcome of the legal actions, investigations, and proceedings brought against us, we\nbelieve that, except for the matters described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our\nconsolidated financial position or liquidity, but could be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting\nperiod. We are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, litigation, claims, and government\ninvestigations in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to the\nclassification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with applicable law. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside\nthe United States where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Although the results of the legal\nproceedings, claims, and government investigations in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe\nthat the final outcome of these matters is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or\noperating results. Regardless of final outcomes, however, any such legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations may\nnonetheless impose a significant burden on management and employees and may come with costly defense costs or unfavorable\npreliminary and interim rulings.\nITEM 4.

          "Overview\nWe are a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to\npower movement from point A to point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of\nofferings on our platform. We connect consumers with providers of ride services, merchants as well as delivery service providers for\nmeal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. We use this\nsame network, technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to connect Shippers with Carriers in the freight industry by\nproviding Carriers with the ability to book a shipment, transportation management and other logistics services. We are also developing\ntechnologies designed to provide new solutions to solve everyday problems.\nDriver Classification Developments\nThe classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United\nStates and abroad. We are involved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action\nlawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before administrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social\nsecurity, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as workers or quasi-employees where those\nstatuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5, 2020, the\nCalifornia Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in\nSan Francisco Superior Court (the “Court”) against Uber and Lyft, Inc., alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an\ninjunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. To\ncomply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a\nguaranteed minimum earnings floor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care. We do not expect these\nchanges will have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\nIf, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees\nwhere those statuses exist, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses associated\nwith the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee\nbenefits, social security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. Additionally, we may not have adequate\nDriver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able\nto hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform. Any of these events could negatively impact our business, results of\noperations, financial position, and cash flows.\nFor a discussion of risk factors related to how misclassification challenges may impact our business, result of operations, financial\nposition and operating condition and cash flows, see the risk factor titled “-Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were\nclassified as employees, workers or quasi-employees” included in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, and Note 14 – Commitments and\nContingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentation\nincluding revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary\nof Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial\nStatements and Supplementary Data,” and the section titled “Critical Accounting Estimates” in Part II, Item 7, of this Annual Report\non Form 10-K.\nFinancial and Operational Highlights\nYear Ended December 31,\n% Change\n(In millions, except percentages) 2023 2024 % Change (Constant Currency (1))\nMonthly Active Platform Consumers (“MAPCs”) (2), (3) 150 171 14 %\nTrips (2) 9,448 11,273 19 %\nGross Bookings (2) $ 137,865 $ 162,773 18 % 21 %\nRevenue $ 37,281 $ 43,978 18 % 19 %\nIncome from operations $ 1,110 $ 2,799 152 %\nNet income attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. $ 1,887 $ 9,856 **\nAdjusted EBITDA (1), (2) $ 4,052 $ 6,484 60 %\nNet cash provided by operating activities (4) $ 3,585 $ 7,137 99 %\nFree cash flow (1), (4) $ 3,362 $ 6,895 105 %\n(1) See the section titled “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information and reconciliations to the most\ndirectly comparable GAAP financial measure.\n(2) See the section titled “Certain Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for more information.\n49",

Delivery Gross Bookings grew 17% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by an increase in Delivery\nTrip volumes. Freight Gross Bookings declined 2% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis.\nRevenue was $44.0 billion, up 18% year-over-year, primarily attributable to an increase in Gross Bookings of 18%. The increase\nin Gross Bookings was primarily driven by an increase in Mobility and Delivery Trip volumes. The increase in revenue was partially\noffset by business model changes in some countries that classified certain sales and marketing costs as contra revenue, which\nnegatively impacted revenue by $863 million and $713 million across Mobility and Delivery, respectively.\nNet income attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. was $9.9 billion, which includes: (i) a $6.4 billion benefit from the release of\nour valuation allowance of certain U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets and (ii) the favorable impact of a pre-tax unrealized gain\non debt and equity securities, net, of $1.8 billion primarily related to changes in the fair value of our equity securities, including: a\n$723 million net unrealized gain on our Grab investment, a $629 million net unrealized gain on our Aurora investment, and a $357\nmillion net unrealized gain on our Didi investment.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $6.5 billion, growing $2.4 billion year-over-year. Mobility Adjusted EBITDA was $6.5 billion, up $1.5\nbillion year-over-year. Delivery Adjusted EBITDA was $2.5 billion, up $965 million year-over-year. These increases were partially\noffset by a $57 million increase in Corporate G&A and Platform R&D costs, year-over-year\nWe ended the year with $7.0 billion in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. During the fourth quarter of\n2024, we redeemed $2.0 billion of our outstanding debt. For additional information, see Note 8 – Long-Term Debt and Revolving\nCredit Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary\nData,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn January 2025, we announced that we entered into an accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreement with a large financial\ninstitution to repurchase $1.5 billion of our outstanding common stock as part of our previously announced Share Repurchase\nProgram. The transactions under the ASR agreement were completed during the first quarter of 2025. For additional information, see\nNote 10 – Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for use of our platform. We have concluded\nthat we are an agent in these arrangements as we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user. Under this model,\nrevenue is net of Driver and Merchant earnings and Driver incentives. We act as an agent in these transactions by connecting\nconsumers to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a Trip, meal, grocery or other delivery service. In certain markets we are responsible\nfor the Mobility or Delivery services (and in most markets we are responsible for the Freight services), and in these markets we\npresent revenue from end-users and from Shippers on a gross basis, with the payments to Drivers and Carriers classified within cost of\nrevenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\nWe would expect revenue to fluctuate on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future based upon factors such as Trip\nvolume, Driver supply, macroeconomic conditions, global travel activities and management pricing and promotional activities. During\nthe year ended December 31, 2023, we implemented a business model change in certain major markets resulting in end-users\nbecoming our customers. Promotions to end-users considered customers are recognized as contra-revenue while promotions to end-\nusers not considered customers are recognized as sales and marketing expenses.\nFor additional discussion related to our revenue, see the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Revenue Recognition” as well as “Note 1 – Description of\nBusiness and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition,” and “Note 2 – Revenue” to our consolidated\n50",
          "financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization\nCost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily consists of costs incurred for certain Mobility and Delivery\ntransactions where we are primarily responsible for Mobility and Delivery services and pay Drivers and Couriers for services, certain\ninsurance costs related to our Mobility and Delivery offerings, costs incurred with Carriers for Uber Freight transportation services,\ncredit card processing fees, bank fees, data center and networking expenses, mobile device and service costs, and amounts related to\nfare chargebacks and other credit card losses.\nWe expect that cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, will fluctuate on an absolute dollar basis for the\nforeseeable future primarily driven by Trip volume changes on the platform.\nOperations and Support\nOperations and support expenses primarily consist of compensation expenses, including stock-based compensation, for employees\nthat support operations in cities, including the general managers, Driver operations, platform user support representatives and\ncommunity managers. Also included is the cost of customer support, Driver background checks and the allocation of certain corporate\ncosts.\nWe would expect operations and support expenses to vary from period to period on an absolute dollar basis, but decrease as a\npercentage of revenue as we become more efficient in supporting platform users.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of advertising costs, product marketing costs, consumer discounts, promotions,\ncredits and refunds provided to end-users who are not customers, compensation costs, including stock-based compensation to sales\nand marketing employees, and the allocation of certain corporate costs. We expense advertising and other promotional expenditures as\nincurred.\nWe would expect sales and marketing expenses to vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue due to timing of\nmarketing campaigns.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we implemented a business model change in certain major markets resulting in end-\nusers becoming our customers. Promotions to end-users considered customers are recognized as contra-revenue while promotions to\nend-users not considered customers are recognized as sales and marketing expenses.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees\nin engineering, design and product development. Expenses also include ongoing improvements to, and maintenance of, existing\nproducts and services, and allocation of certain corporate costs. We expense substantially all research and development expenses as\nincurred.\nWe would expect research and development expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis and vary from period to period as a\npercentage of revenue as we continue to invest in research and development activities relating to ongoing improvements to and\nmaintenance of our platform offerings and other research and development programs.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for executive\nmanagement and administrative employees, including finance and accounting, human resources, policy and communications, legal,\nand certain impairment charges, as well as allocation of certain corporate costs, occupancy, and general corporate insurance costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses also include certain legal related accruals and expenses.\nWe would expect general and administrative expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future as our\nbusiness continues to grow and Trip volume increases, but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we achieve improved fixed cost\nleverage and efficiencies in our internal support functions. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue may vary\nfrom period to period as a percentage of revenue due to the variability of legal and regulatory-related expenses.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation on buildings, site improvements, computer and network\nequipment, software, leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and amortization of intangible assets. Depreciation includes\nexpenses associated with buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, and furniture, fixtures, as well as leasehold\nimprovements. Amortization includes expenses associated with our capitalized internal-use software and acquired intangible assets.\n51",
          "Interest Expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest expense associated with our outstanding debt, including amortization of debt\ndiscount and issuance costs. For additional detail related to our debt obligations, see “Note 8 – Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit\nArrangements” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,”\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net primarily includes the following items:\n• Interest income, which consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments,\nrestricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted investments.\n• Foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net, which consist primarily of remeasurement of transactions and monetary assets\nand liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency at the end of the period.\n• Gain on business divestitures, net.\n• Gain (loss) from sale of investments.\n• Unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, net, which consists primarily of gains (losses) from fair value\nadjustments relating to our marketable and non-marketable securities.\n• Impairment of equity method investment.\n• Revaluation of MLU B.V. call option, which represents changes in fair value recorded on the call option granted to Yandex\n(“MLU B.V. Call Option”).\n• Acquisition termination fee.\n• Other, net.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. These foreign jurisdictions\nhave different statutory tax rates than those in the United States. Additionally, certain of our foreign earnings may also be taxable in\nthe United States. Accordingly, our effective tax rate will vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to domestic income,\nchanges in the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, and changes in tax laws.\nThe income tax benefit was $5.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes a $6.4 billion benefit related to the\nrelease of our valuation allowance on the U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, with the exception of our California R&D credits\nand other non-material deferred tax assets.\nWe regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. In making that assessment, we consider\nboth positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets to determine, based on the weight\nof all available evidence, whether it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we demonstrated sustained profitability in the U.S. based on U.S. pre-tax book income adjusted for\npermanent book-to-tax differences. Further, given our taxable income position for the annual period ended on December 31, 2024, we\nutilized more attributes than we generated, which reduces our U.S. federal and state net deferred tax assets. This information is both\nobjective and verifiable; thereby, representing strong positive evidence that carries significant weight.\nBased on all available positive and negative evidence, including the objective and verifiable positive evidence as described above\nand anticipated future earnings, we concluded it is more-likely-than-not that a majority of our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets\nwill be realizable. We continue to maintain a valuation allowance against the California R&D credits, as we believe it is not more-\nlikely-than-not to be realized, as we expect R&D tax credit generation to exceed our ability to use these credits in future periods.\nFurthermore, based on available evidence, we believe it is more-likely-than-not that the Netherlands’ net deferred tax assets will\nnot be fully realizable. We will continue to maintain a valuation allowance against these net deferred tax assets. We regularly review\nthe deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of\nthe reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies by jurisdiction.\nBased on our assessment of current income and anticipated future earnings, there is a reasonable possibility that we will have\nsufficient evidence to release a significant portion of the valuation allowance in the Netherlands within the next 12 months. However,\nour judgment regarding future earnings and the exact timing and amount of any valuation allowance release is subject to change due to\nmany factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and/or tax planning\nstrategies. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of net deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance\nsheet and would result in an income tax benefit in the period the release is recorded.\n52",
          "The Inflation Reduction Act Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (“CAMT”), which is a minimum tax calculated by reference to\nfinancial statement income, does not apply to the Company for the year ended December 31, 2024. We could be subject to the CAMT\nin future years, which would require us to make minimum cash tax payments.\nIn addition, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has led international efforts among approximately 140\ncountries and taxing jurisdictions to propose and implement changes to numerous long-standing tax principles, including a framework\nthat imposes a minimum tax rate of 15% in each taxing jurisdiction. Under this guidance, we will be required to determine a combined\neffective tax rate for all entities located in a jurisdiction. If the jurisdictional effective tax rate determined under these rules is less than\n15%, a top-up tax will be due to bring the jurisdictional effective tax rate up to 15%. We are continuing to monitor the pending\nimplementation of these rules by individual countries and the potential impact on our business.

In making that assessment, we consider\nboth positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets to determine, based on the weight\nof all available evidence, whether it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we demonstrated sustained profitability in the U.S. based on U.S. pre-tax book income adjusted for\npermanent book-to-tax differences. Further, given our taxable income position for the annual period ended on December 31, 2024, we\nutilized more attributes than we generated, which reduces our U.S. federal and state net deferred tax assets. This information is both\nobjective and verifiable; thereby, representing strong positive evidence that carries significant weight.\nBased on all available positive and negative evidence, including the objective and verifiable positive evidence as described above\nand anticipated future earnings, we concluded it is more-likely-than-not that a majority of our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets\nwill be realizable. We continue to maintain a valuation allowance against the California R&D credits, as we believe it is not more-\nlikely-than-not to be realized, as we expect R&D tax credit generation to exceed our ability to use these credits in future periods.\nProvision for income taxes decreased by $6.0 billion primarily attributable to the release of $6.4 billion of our valuation\nallowance of certain U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nIncome from Equity Method Investments\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In millions, except percentages) 2023 2024 % Change\nIncome (loss) from equity method investments $ 48 $ (38) **\nPercentage of revenue — % — %\n** Percentage not meaningful.\n2024 Compared to 2023\nThe change in income (loss) from equity method investments primarily due to our portion of the net income (loss) of our equity\nmethod investment in Careem Technologies in 2024.\nSegment Results of Operations\nWe operate our business as three operating and reportable segments: Mobility, Delivery, and Freight.

          "Certain Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information about how we use this and other non-GAAP financial\nmeasures in our business, the limitations of these measures, and reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable\nGAAP financial measures, see the section titled “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nMonthly Active Platform Consumers. MAPCs is the number of unique consumers who completed a Mobility ride or received a\nDelivery order on our platform at least once in a given month, averaged over each month in the quarter. While a unique consumer can\nuse multiple product offerings on our platform in a given month, that unique consumer is counted as only one MAPC. We use MAPCs\nto assess the adoption of our platform and frequency of transactions, which are key factors in our penetration of the countries in which\nwe operate.\nTrips. We define Trips as the number of completed consumer Mobility rides and Delivery orders in a given period. For example,\nan UberX Share ride with three paying consumers represents three unique Trips, whereas an UberX ride with three passengers\nrepresents one Trip. We believe that Trips are a useful metric to measure the scale and usage of our platform.\n59",
          "Gross Bookings. We define Gross Bookings as the total dollar value, including any applicable taxes, tolls, and fees, of: Mobility\nrides, Delivery orders (in each case without any adjustment for consumer discounts and refunds, Driver and Merchant earnings, and\nDriver incentives) and Freight revenue. Gross Bookings do not include tips earned by Drivers. Gross Bookings are an indication of the\nscale of our current platform, which ultimately impacts revenue.\n(In millions) Q1 2023 Q2 2023 Q3 2023 Q4 2023 Q1 2024 Q2 2024 Q3 2024 Q4 2024\nMobility $ 14,981 $ 16,728 $ 17,903 $ 19,285 $ 18,670 $ 20,554 $ 21,002 $ 22,798\nDelivery 15,026 15,595 16,094 17,011 17,699 18,126 18,663 20,126\nFreight 1,401 1,278 1,284 1,279 1,282 1,272 1,308 1,273\nAdjusted EBITDA.

In addition\nto revenue, net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, and other results under GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA, revenue\ngrowth rates in constant currency and free cash flow, which are described below, to evaluate our business. We use these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe\nthat these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding\ncertain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results.\nWe believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our\nperformance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate\nmanagement’s internal comparisons to our historical performance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to\ninvestors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and\noperational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the\nhealth of our business. Accordingly, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and\nothers in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors. Our\ncalculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures, if any, reported by our peer\ncompanies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, financial\ninformation prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n60",
          "Adjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), excluding (i) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes,\n(ii) net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax, (iii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (iv) income\n(loss) from equity method investments, (v) interest expense, (vi) other income (expense), net, (vii) depreciation and amortization, (viii)\nstock-based compensation expense, (ix) certain legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements, (x) goodwill and asset\nimpairments/loss on sale of assets, (xi) acquisition, financing and divestitures related expenses, (xii) restructuring and related charges\nand (xiii) other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance.\nWe have included Adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key measure used by our management\nteam to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions, including those relating to\noperating expenses. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in\nunderstanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors. In addition, it\nprovides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of certain non-cash expenses and\ncertain variable charges.\nLegal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements\nLegal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements are primarily related to certain significant legal proceedings or\ngovernmental investigations related to worker classification definitions, or tax agencies challenging our non-income tax positions.\nThese matters have limited precedent, cover extended historical periods and are unpredictable in both magnitude and timing, therefore\nare distinct from normal, recurring legal, tax and regulatory matters and related expenses incurred in our ongoing operating\nperformance.\nLimitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature, and is not meant as a\nsubstitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These limitations include the following:\n• Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain recurring, non-cash charges, such as depreciation of property and equipment and\namortization of intangible assets, and although these are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may\nhave to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect all cash capital expenditure requirements for such\nreplacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;\n• Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable\nfuture, a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of our compensation strategy;\n• Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain restructuring and related charges, part of which may be settled in cash;\n• Adjusted EBITDA excludes other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance;\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect period-to-period changes in taxes, income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay\nincome taxes;\n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the components of other income (expense), net, which primarily includes: interest income;\nforeign currency exchange gains (losses), net; gain (loss) on business divestitures, net; unrealized gain (loss) on debt and\nequity securities, net; and impairment of debt and equity securities; and\n• Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements that may reduce cash available\nto us.\n61",

For additional information on this matter, refer to Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated\nfinancial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $3.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily consisting of $12.8 billion\nin purchases of marketable securities, $289 million in purchases of non-marketable equity securities, $242 million in purchases of\nproperty and equipment, partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities of $10.2 billion.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $3.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily consisting of $8.8 billion in\npurchases of marketable securities, $223 million in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by proceeds from maturities\nand sales of marketable securities of $5.1 billion and proceeds from the sale of an equity method investment of $721 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily consisting of $4.0 billion\nin principal repayment on term loan and notes, $1.3 billion in repurchases of common stock, $851 million in redemption of non-\ncontrolling interests, and $172 million of principal payments on finance leases, partially offset by $4.0 billion of proceeds from\nissuance of term loan and notes, net of issuance costs. For additional information, see Note 8 – Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit\nArrangements to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $95 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily consisting of $2.7 billion\nin principal repayment on term loan and notes, $171 million of principal payments on finance leases and $141 million to fund the cost\nof entering into the capped call transactions related to our 2028 Convertible Notes, partially offset by $2.8 billion of proceeds from\nissuance of term loan and notes, net of issuance costs. For additional information, see Note 8 – Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit\nArrangements to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOther Information\nAs of December 31, 2024, $2.7 billion of our $5.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash\nheld outside the United States may be repatriated, subject to certain limitations, and would be available to be used to fund our\ndomestic operations. Repatriation of funds may result in immaterial tax liabilities.\nWe believe that our existing cash balance in the United States is sufficient to fund our working capital needs in the United States.\nWe are in compliance with our debt and line of credit covenants as of December 31, 2024, including by meeting our reporting\nobligations. We also believe that our sources of funding and our available line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our currently\nanticipated cash requirements including capital expenditures, working capital requirements, collateral requirements, potential\nacquisitions, potential prepayments of contested indirect tax assessments (“pay-to-play”), and other liquidity requirements through at\nleast the next 12 months. We intend to continue to evaluate and may, in certain circumstances, take preemptive action to preserve\nliquidity.\nDebt Redemptions\nOn September 12, 2024, we exercised the call option for a partial redemption of $500 million for the 2027 Senior Note. The\npartial redemption was completed on October 3, 2024. In addition, on October 2, 2024, we exercised the call option to redeem the $1.5\nbillion 2026 Senior Note, we completed the redemption on November 1, 2024.

The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases are determined by the discretion\nof management, depending on market conditions and other factors. Repurchases may be made through open market purchases and\naccelerated share repurchases. The exact number of shares to be repurchased by us, if any, is not guaranteed. Depending on market\nconditions and other factors, these repurchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or periodically without prior notice. As\nof December 31, 2024, we had $5.8 billion available to repurchase shares pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program For additional\ninformation, see Note 10 – Stockholders' Equity in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn January 2025, we announced that we entered into an accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreement with a large financial\ninstitution to repurchase $1.5 billion of our outstanding common stock as part of our previously announced Share Repurchase\nProgram. The transactions under the ASR agreement were completed during the first quarter of 2025.\nFreight Series A Preferred Stock\nOn October 6, 2023, the 2020 Freight Series A Investor exercised their right to require that either Freight Holding conduct an IPO\nor we redeem them. Upon the redemption date in October 2024, we repurchased the 2020 Freight Series A Investor’s Freight Series A\npreferred stock in cash for $851 million. For additional information, see Note 16 – Non-Controlling Interests in the notes to the\nconsolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report\non Form 10-K.\nNon-Income Tax Matters\nUnited Kingdom\nAs of March 14, 2022, we modified our operating model in the UK, such that as of that date Uber UK is a merchant of\ntransportation and is required to remit VAT. Uber UK is remitting VAT under the Value Added (Tour Operators) Order 1987 (“VAT\nOrder 1987”), which allows for VAT remittance on a calculated margin, rather than on Gross Bookings.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we have received multiple assessments from the HMRC disputing our application of VAT Order 1987\nfor the period of March 2022 to June 2024, totaling approximately $1.6 billion (£1.3 billion) for unpaid VAT. Uber paid the\nassessments in order to proceed with the appeal process. The payments do not represent our acceptance of the assessments.\nThe payments made in 2023 and 2024 are recorded as a receivable in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet because we\nbelieve that we will be successful in our appeal, upon which, the full amount of our payments will be returned to us with interest upon\ncompletion of the appeals process. We expect to receive additional assessments related to this matter and will be required to pay the\nassessments in order to continue with the appeals process. Any payments are expected to decrease operating cash flow and have no\nimpact on our results of operations. We plan to vigorously defend our application of the VAT Order 1987 and are waiting to obtain\nhearing dates from the Tax Tribunal. For additional information, see Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies in the section titled\n“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCommitments\nLeases\nOur operating lease portfolio primarily consists of corporate offices. For additional information, see Note 6 - Leases in the notes\nto the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\nLong-Term Debt\nWe have long-term debt with varying maturities dates through 2054. For additional information, see Note 8 – Long-Term Debt\nand Revolving Credit Arrangements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial\nStatements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPurchase Commitments\nWe have non-cancelable commitments which primarily relate to network and cloud services and other items in the ordinary course\nof business. These amounts are determined based on the non-cancelable quantities to which we are contractually obligated.\nIn November 2022, we entered into commercial technology agreements with vendors for cloud computing services (“2022 Cloud\nComputing Service Agreements”). We are committed to spend an aggregate of at least $2.5 billion through November 2029, of which\n$412 million is short-term. We may pay more than the minimum purchase commitment to our cloud-computing web services\n64",
          "providers based on usage. For the year ended December 31, 2024, Uber satisfied its commitment for the 2022 Cloud Computing\nService Agreements.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $2.7 billion in non-cancelable commitments, this includes the $2.5 billion in 2022 Cloud\nComputing Service Agreements discussed above. The non-cancellable commitments have varying expiration terms through November\n2029.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe believe that the following accounting policies involve a high degree of judgment and complexity and are critical to\nunderstanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of our operations. An accounting policy is considered to\nbe critical if it requires judgment on a significant accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are\nuncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the\naccounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,\nrevenue and expenses, and related disclosures in our audited consolidated financial statements. We have based our estimates on\nhistorical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which\nform the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nAlthough we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates,\nactual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.\nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used\nin the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. For additional information, see the disclosure included in Note 1 –\nDescription of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included\nin Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue from service fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for the use of our platform in connection with our\nMobility products and Delivery offering provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users. Our sole performance obligation in the\ntransaction is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-users to facilitate the completion of a successful ridesharing trip or delivery.\nIn many of our markets, we also generate revenue from end-users and charge a direct fee for use of the platform or in exchange for\nMobility or Delivery services.\nJudgment is required in evaluating the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we control the service\nprovided to the end-user and are the principal in the transaction (gross), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the\nend-user and are the agent in the transaction (net). The assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent in a\ntransaction could impact the accounting for certain payments and incentives provided to Drivers and end-users and change the amount\nof revenue recognized.\nEnd-User Discounts and Promotions\nWe offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not customers) to encourage use of our platform. Judgment is required to\ndetermine the appropriate classification of these incentives. End-user discounts and promotions are recorded to sales and marketing\nexpenses with the exception of market-wide promotions which are recorded as a reduction of revenue.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets\nacquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these\nidentifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and\nassumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not\nlimited to, future expected cash flows from acquired advertiser, fleet, merchant, and end-user contracts, acquired technology, and trade\nnames, based on expected future growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and royalty for similar brand\nlicenses, useful lives, and discount rates.\nManagement's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain\nand unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets\nand liabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas\nany indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which may be up to one\nyear from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset\nto goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nInvestments—Non-Marketable Equity and Debt Securities\nWe hold investments in privately held companies in the form of equity securities and debt securities without readily determinable\nfair values and in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence. Investments in equity securities without readily\ndeterminable fair values are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently adjusted to fair value for impairments and price changes\n65",
          "from observable transactions in the same or a similar security from the same issuer. Investments in material available-for-sale debt\nsecurities are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date with the changes in fair\nvalue recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We may elect the fair value option for financial instruments and\naccount for investments in debt and equity securities at fair value with changes reported in net income (loss) from continuing\noperations.\nInvestments in privately held equity and debt securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in inactive\nmarkets. This valuation requires judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity and are classified as\nLevel 3 in the fair value hierarchy. In determining the estimated fair value of our investments in privately held companies, we utilize\nthe most recent data available including observed transactions such as equity financing transactions of the investees and sales of the\nexisting shares of the investees’ securities. In addition, the determination of whether an observed transaction is similar to the equity\nand debt securities held by us requires significant management judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities.\nWe assess our investment portfolio of privately held equity and debt securities quarterly for impairment. The impairment analysis\nfor investments in equity securities includes a qualitative analysis of factors including the investee’s financial performance, industry\nand market conditions, and other relevant factors. If an equity investment is considered to be impaired we will establish a new\ncarrying value for the investment and recognize an impairment loss through our consolidated statement of operations. Investments in\ndebt securities are evaluated for impairment quarterly based on whether its fair value has declined below its amortized cost. In\ncircumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell the security before it recovers its amortized cost\nbasis, the difference between the fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated financial statement of\noperations, with a corresponding write-down of the security’s amortized cost. In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then\nevaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can\ninclude the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan\nobligor’s, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we\ncompare the present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the security’s effective interest rate to the amortized\ncost basis of the security. A credit-related impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and\nrecognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to net income (loss).\nAny remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.\nImprovements in expected cash flows due to improvements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and\ncorresponding reduction in the allowance for credit loss.\nEquity Method Investments\nWe account for investments in the common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to\nexercise significant influence, but not a controlling financial interest, using the equity method. Investments accounted for under the\nequity method are initially recorded at cost. Subsequently, we recognize through the consolidated statements of operations, and as an\nadjustment to the investment balance, our proportionate share of the investee entities’ net income or loss, and the amortization of basis\ndifferences. In accounting for these investments, we record our share of the entities’ net income or loss one quarter in arrears. Equity\nmethod investments for which the fair value option is elected are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value\nreflected in earnings.\nWe review our equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the\ncarrying value of the investment may not be fully recoverable. Qualitative and quantitative factors considered as indicators of a\npotential impairment include financial results and operating trends of the investees, implied values in transactions of the investee’s\nsecurities, severity and length of decline in value, and our intention for holding the investment, among other factors. If an impairment\nis determined to be other-than-temporary, the fair value of the impaired investment would have to be determined and an impairment\ncharge recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the investment. The fair value determination,\nparticularly for investments in privately held companies, requires significant judgment to determine appropriate estimates and\nassumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the calculation of the fair value of the investments and the\ndetermination of the impairment charges.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment\nWe review goodwill for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate\nthat goodwill might be impaired. We make certain judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and in allocating\nshared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. Determination of reporting units is based\non a judgmental evaluation of the level at which our segment managers review financial results, evaluate performance, and allocate\nresources.\nJudgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include, among other factors: financial performance; legal,\nregulatory, contractual, political, business, and other factors; entity specific factors; industry and market considerations,\nmacroeconomic conditions, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. To the extent we determine that it is\nmore likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed.\n66",
          "Performing a quantitative goodwill impairment test includes the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and involves\nsignificant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include, among others, revenue growth rates and operating\nmargins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and the\ndetermination of appropriate market comparables.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, indirect tax examinations, or government inquiries and\ninvestigations that may arise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or\nindeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the\namount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably\nestimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously\nrecorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our\ndisclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\nSignificant judgment is required to determine both the probability and the estimated amount of loss. These estimates have been based\non our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based on new information and\nfuture events.\nThe outcomes of litigation, regulatory, indirect tax examinations and investigations are inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or\nmore of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, our results of operations,\nfinancial condition, or cash flows, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and\nestimable, could be materially adversely affected.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. We account for income taxes using the asset and\nliability method. The establishment of deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers of intangible assets requires management to make\nsignificant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of such intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing intangible\nassets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue and expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible\nassets, comparable transaction values, and/or discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present\nvalue are derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow.\nAlthough we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical\nexperience, internal and external comparable data and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur\nthat could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\nWe account for uncertainty in tax positions by recognizing a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more-likely-than-\nnot that the position will be sustained upon examination. Evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for\nincome taxes are inherently uncertain and require making judgments, assumptions, and estimates. While we believe we have\nadequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be\ndifferent. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. To the extent that the\nfinal tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact the provision for income taxes\nand the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.\nThe provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the related net interest\nand penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities\nwhich may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations\nand assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\nThe income tax benefit was $5.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes a $6.4 billion benefit related to the\nrelease of our valuation allowance on the U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, with the exception of our California R&D credits\nand other non-material deferred tax assets.\nWe regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. In making that assessment, we consider\nboth positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets to determine, based on the weight\nof all available evidence, whether it is more-likely-than -not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we demonstrated sustained profitability in the U.S. based on U.S. pre-tax book income adjusted for\npermanent book-to-tax differences. Further, given our taxable income position for the annual period ended on December 31, 2024, we\nutilized more attributes than we generated, which reduces our U.S. federal and state net deferred tax assets. This information is both\nobjective and verifiable; thereby, representing strong positive evidence that carries significant weight.\nBased on all available positive and negative evidence, including the objective and verifiable positive evidence as described above\nand anticipated future earnings, we concluded it is more-likely-than-not that a majority of our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets\n67",
          "will be realizable. We continue to maintain a valuation allowance against the California R&D credits, as we believe it is not more-\nlikely-than-not to be realized, as we expect R&D tax credit generation to exceed our ability to use these credits in future periods.\nFurthermore, based on available evidence, we believe it is more-likely-than-not that the Netherlands’ net deferred tax assets will\nnot be fully realizable. We will continue to maintain a valuation allowance against these net deferred tax assets. We regularly review\nthe deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of\nthe reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies by jurisdiction.\nBased on our assessment of current income and anticipated future earnings, there is a reasonable possibility that we will have\nsufficient evidence to release a significant portion of the valuation allowance in the Netherlands within the next 12 months. However,\nour judgment regarding future earnings and the exact timing and amount of any valuation allowance release is subject to change due to\nmany factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and/or tax planning\nstrategies. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of net deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance\nsheet and would result in an income tax benefit in the period the release is recorded.\nInsurance Reserves\nWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance\nsubsidiary, to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks, including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto\nphysical damage, general liability, and workers’ compensation. Insurance reserves is an estimate of our potential liability for unpaid\nlosses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for such insurance related risks\nand includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of the\nbalance sheet date. The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical\nclaim and loss experience. In addition, we use assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns\nand expected loss costs, which consider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data. These reserves are continually\nreviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known. Adjustments to reserves retained by us, if any,\nrelating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations.\nAll estimates of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserves, are subject to inherent\nvariability caused by the nature of the insurance claim settlement process. Such variability is increased for us due to limited historical\nexperience and the nature of the coverage provided. Actual results depend upon the outcome of future contingent events and can be\naffected by many factors, such as claim settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal, and social environments. As a result,\nthe net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability, and when these amounts will be paid, may vary in the near term from\nthe estimated amounts.\nWhile management believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than,\nthe amount provided.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements\nincluded in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment\nrisk, and foreign currency risk as follows:\nInterest Rate Risk\nAs of June 30, 2024, we had approximately $1.97 billion in aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 2030 Refinanced Term\nLoans, which were floating rate notes carried at amortized cost and subject to interest rate risk. In September 2024, we fully repaid all\nloans outstanding under this term loan agreement. As a result, our primary exposure to market risks for changes in interest rates relate\nprimarily to the new Credit Agreement of which we currently have no drawn amounts as of December 31, 2024. For additional\ninformation, see Note 8 – Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit Arrangements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements\nincluded in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining\nrates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would\nhave decreased the fair value of our notes by $461 million as of December 31, 2024.\nInvestment Risk\nOur investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution or commercial issuer. Cash deposits\ntypically exceed insured limits and are placed with financial institutions around the world that we believe are of high credit quality.\nThese deposits are in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance limits. There can be no assurance that\nour deposits in excess of the FDIC limits will be backstopped by the U.S., or that any bank or financial institution with which we do\n68",
          "business will be able to obtain needed liquidity from other banks, government institutions or by acquisition in the event of a failure or\nliquidity crisis.\nOur investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. We\nhad cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.0 billion and $8.6 billion as of December 31,\n2023 and December 31, 2024, respectively. Marketable debt securities classified as restricted investments and short-term investments\ntotaled $8.1 billion as of December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities\nprimarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and\ninvestment-grade corporate debt securities. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed\nrate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-\nterm nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our\nfinancial results.\nWe are exposed to certain risks related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned,\nprivately-held entities and public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private\ncompany stock which are inherently difficult to value given the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities\nwith readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk. These investments in privately-held entities and public\ncompanies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes in the fair value of these investments.\nIn certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period\nof time after a public offering. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these investments was $8.8 billion, including equity\nmethod investments.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in\nforeign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to\nforeign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\nAccordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our future revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S.\ndollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is diversified\nacross geographic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or\n(losses) related to remeasurement of our asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional\ncurrency of the entities in which they are recorded.

          "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Uber Technologies, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Uber Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income (loss), of redeemable\nnon-controlling interests and equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the\nrelated notes and financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial\nstatements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of\nthe Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the\nperiod ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in\nour opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,\n2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s\nReport on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We\nare a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits\nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to\nerror or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the\nconsolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well\nas evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting\nincluded obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included\nperforming such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable\nbasis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the\ncompany; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect\non the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial\nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or\ncomplex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial\n71",
          "statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the\ncritical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nPresentation of Mobility and Delivery Revenue Agreements, Including Incentives, Discounts and Promotions to Drivers, Merchants\nand End-Users\nAs described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company derives its revenues from Drivers’ and\nMerchants’ use of the Company’s platform, on-demand lead generation, and related services in connection with Mobility and Delivery\nservices, as well as from direct fees charged to end-users for use of the platform or in exchange for Mobility or Delivery services.\nManagement applies judgment in determining whether the Company is the principal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants\nand end-users. This determination impacts the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis as well as the presentation of incentives\nprovided to Drivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users, to the extent they are not customers. For the\nyear ended December 31, 2024, the Company’s Mobility and Delivery revenue was $38.8 billion and consumer discounts, promotions,\ncredits and refunds provided to end-users who are not customers totaled $1.4 billion, of which a significant portion relates to discounts\nand promotions.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the presentation of Mobility and Delivery\nrevenue agreements, including incentives, discounts and promotions to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users is a critical audit matter are\nthe significant judgment by management in assessing the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis, as well as the presentation of\nincentives, discounts and promotions offered to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor\njudgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to whether transaction attributes\nwere appropriately analyzed and presented by management.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion\non the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls related to the Company’s\nrevenue recognition process, including controls over the presentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue, incentives, discounts and\npromotions. These procedures also included, among others, testing, on a sample basis, trip transaction attributes and assessing\nmanagement’s classification of new or changed agreements by examining documentation of the agreement terms, trip receipts, and\nother support, and assessing the impact of those terms and attributes on the presentation of revenue and income statement\nclassification.\nValuation of Insurance Reserves\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, insurance reserves is an estimate of the liability for unpaid losses and\nloss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for certain insurance related risks, including\nauto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, general liability, and workers’ compensation, and includes\nan amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date.\nThe estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss\nexperience. In addition, management uses assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and\nexpected loss costs, which consider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data. These reserves are continually\nreviewed by management and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known. The Company’s short-term and\nlong-term insurance reserves as of December 31, 2024 totaled $9.8 billion.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves is a\ncritical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing the estimate of the insurance reserves, which in\nturn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating\nto the actuarial methods and management’s significant assumptions related to loss development patterns and expected loss costs. The\naudit effort also involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion\non the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company’s\nvaluation of insurance reserves, including controls over the development of the significant assumptions related to loss development\npatterns and expected loss costs. These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill\nand knowledge to assist in (i) developing, for selected reserve components, an independent actuarial estimate of the insurance\nreserves, and comparison of this independent estimate to management’s actuarially determined reserves, and (ii) testing, for other\nselected reserve components, management’s process for estimating the insurance reserves. Developing the independent estimate\ninvolved independently developing the loss development patterns and expected loss costs and testing the completeness and accuracy\nof data provided by management. Testing management’s process for estimating the insurance reserves involved evaluating the\nappropriateness of management’s actuarial methods, evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by\nmanagement related to loss development patterns and expected loss costs used in those methods, and testing the completeness and\naccuracy of data used by management.\n72",

          "UBER TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\nUber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is\nheadquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology,\noperational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. Uber develops and operates proprietary\ntechnology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (“platform(s)” or “Platform(s)”). Uber connects consumers\n(“Rider(s)”) with independent providers of ride services (“Mobility Driver(s)”) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other\nconsumers (“Eaters”) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, “Merchants”) with delivery service providers\n(“Couriers”) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as “end-user(s)”\nor “consumer(s).” Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as “Driver(s).” Uber also connects consumers with public\ntransportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers\n(“Shippers”) with carriers (“Carriers”) in the freight industry. The foundation of our platform is this network of Drivers, Couriers,\nMerchants, Carriers as well as Riders, Eaters and Shippers (collectively “Platform Participant(s)”). We define Platform Earner(s) as\nDrivers, Couriers and Merchants as well as Carriers. Uber is also developing technologies designed to provide new solutions to solve\neveryday problems.\nOur technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada, Latin America, Europe (excluding\nRussia), the Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific (“APAC”, excluding China and Southeast Asia).\nFoodpanda Taiwan\nIn May 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement with Delivery Hero SE (“Delivery Hero”) to acquire 100% ownership\ninterest in Delivery Hero’s Foodpanda delivery business in Taiwan (“Foodpanda Taiwan”) for approximately $950 million in cash, on\na cash and debt free basis, subject to certain adjustments. In January 2025, the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission issued a decision\nprohibiting the transaction. If we do not appeal the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission’s decision, we expect to pay a termination fee\nduring the first half of 2025. We expect the termination fee to be settled in either (i) cash or (ii) by returning our initial investment in\nordinary shares of Delivery Hero (which Delivery Hero has the option to accept, or alternatively request equivalent cash), and, as of\nDecember 31, 2024, we recorded an expense of $236 million in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of\noperations. Refer to Note 3 – Investments and Fair Value Measurement for further details on the Delivery Hero investment.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples in the United States (“GAAP”). We consolidate our wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned subsidiaries over which\nwe exercise control, and variable interest entities (“VIEs”) where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Refer to Note 15 –\nVariable Interest Entities for further information. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nPrior period amounts on the consolidated balance sheet, and notes thereto, have been reclassified to conform to the current period\npresentation. Certain insurance reserves in accrued and other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities were reclassified to\nshort-term and long-term insurance reserves, respectively. Deferred tax assets, previously presented within other assets, were\nreclassified to be presented separately on our consolidated balance sheet. These reclassifications had no impact on our previously\nreported total assets, total liabilities, results of operations, comprehensive income or net cash flows from operating, financing or\ninvesting activities.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions, which affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical\nexperience, where applicable, and other assumptions which management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. On an\nongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: fair values of investments and other financial\ninstruments (including the measurement of credit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value of\nacquired intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment of goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and\nnon-income tax reserves; certain deferred tax assets and tax liabilities; insurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities. These\nestimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates.\n82",
          "Concentration of Credit Risk\nCash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, restricted investments, other receivables,\nand accounts receivable are potentially subject to credit risk concentration. Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities\nprimarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government and agency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt\nsecurities. Our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution or commercial issuer. Cash\ndeposits typically exceed insured limits and are placed with financial institutions around the world that we believe are of high credit\nquality. We have not experienced any material losses related to these concentrations during the periods presented. We rely on third\nparties to provide payment processing services (“payment service providers”) to collect amounts due from end-users. Payment service\nproviders are financial institutions or credit card companies that we believe are of high credit quality. No customers accounted for 10%\nor more of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash held in checking and savings accounts as well as investments in money market funds,\nU.S. government and agency securities, commercial paper, corporate bonds, and time deposits. We consider all highly-liquid\ninvestments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.\nCash includes amounts collected on behalf of, but not yet remitted to Drivers and Merchants, which are included in accrued and other\ncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nRestricted Cash and Cash Equivalents\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents are pledged as security for letters of credit or other collateral amounts established by us for\ncertain insurance policies and also include cash and cash equivalents that are unavailable for immediate use due to legal and/or\ncontractual restrictions. Restricted cash and cash equivalents are classified as current and non-current assets based on the contractual\nor estimated term of the remaining restriction. The reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents\nto amounts presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows are as follows (in millions):\nAs of December 31,\n2022 2023 2024\nCash and cash equivalents $ 4,208 $ 4,680 $ 5,893\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents - current 680 805 545\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents - non-current 1,789 1,519 2,172\nTotal cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents $ 6,677 $ 7,004 $ 8,610\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable represents: (i) uncollected payments from end-users for completed transactions where the payment method is\ncredit card and includes (a) end-user payments not yet settled with payment service providers and (b) end-user payments settled by\npayment service providers but not yet remitted to us; (ii) completed shipments where we have an unconditional right to the\nconsideration from Freight customers (“Shippers”) and payment has not been received; or (iii) uncollected payments from Uber for\nBusiness organizations for completed transactions. The timing of settlement of amounts due from these parties varies by region and by\nproduct. The portion of the receivable to be remitted to Drivers and Merchants is included in accrued and other current liabilities on\nthe consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 9 – Supplemental Financial Statement Information for amounts payable to Drivers and\nMerchants.\nAlthough we pre-authorize forms of payment to mitigate our exposure, we bear the cost of any accounts receivable losses. We\nrecord an allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable that may never settle or be collected, as well as for credit card\nchargebacks including fraudulent credit card transactions. The allowance for doubtful accounts is primarily included as cost of revenue\nin the consolidated statements of operations. We estimate the allowance based on historical experience, estimated future payments and\ngeographical trends, which are reviewed periodically and as needed, and amounts are written off when determined to be uncollectible.\nChargebacks and credit card losses were $286 million, $245 million and $252 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023\nand 2024, respectively.\n83",
          "Property and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is\ncomputed using the straight‑line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are as follows:\nProperty and Equipment Estimated Useful Life\nLand Indefinite\nBuildings 30-45 years\nSite improvements 5-15 years\nComputer equipment 3-5 years\nFurniture and fixtures 3-5 years\nInternal-use software 2 years\nMotor vehicles and other equipment 3-10 years\nLeased computer equipment Shorter of estimated useful life or lease term\nLeasehold improvements Shorter of estimated useful life or lease term\nWhen assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost, accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the\naccounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations in the period realized. Maintenance\nand repairs that do not enhance or extend the asset’s useful life are charged to operating expenses as incurred.\nWe capitalize certain costs, such as compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, and interest incurred on outstanding\ndebt, in developing internal-use software once planning has been completed, management has authorized and committed project\nfunding, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will function as intended. Amortization of such costs\noccurs on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset and begins once the asset is ready for its intended use.\nCosts incurred prior to meeting these criteria, together with costs incurred for training and maintenance, are expensed as incurred. In\naddition, we capitalize interest incurred on outstanding debt during the period of construction-in-progress of certain assets.\nLeases\nWe account for leases in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842, “Leases” (“ASC 842”). We made a\npolicy election not to separate non-lease components from lease components, therefore, we account for lease and non-lease\ncomponents as a single lease component. We also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify.\nWe determine if a contract contains a lease at inception of the arrangement based on whether we have the right to obtain\nsubstantially all of the economic benefits from the use of an identified asset and whether we have the right to direct the use of an\nidentified asset in exchange for consideration, which relates to an asset which we do not own. Right of use (“ROU”) assets represent\nour right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from\nthe lease. ROU assets are recognized as the lease liability, adjusted for lease incentives received. Lease liabilities are recognized at the\npresent value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the\nfuture lease payments is our incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”), because the interest rate implicit in most of our leases is not readily\ndeterminable. The IBR is a hypothetical rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be to borrow and resulting\ninterest we would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment over the lease term on a\ncollateralized basis. Lease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixed payments or in-substance fixed payments are\nincluded in our lease liability calculation. Variable lease payments may include costs such as common area maintenance, utilities, real\nestate taxes or other costs. Variable lease payments are recognized in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for those\npayments are incurred.\nOperating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current and operating lease liabilities, non-\ncurrent on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued and other current\nliabilities, and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. For operating leases, lease expense is recognized on a\nstraight-line basis in operations over the lease term. For finance leases, lease expense is recognized as depreciation and interest;\ndepreciation on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest using the effective interest method.\nAcquisitions\nWe account for acquisitions of entities or asset groups that qualify as businesses in accordance with ASC 805, “Business\nCombinations” (“ASC 805”). The purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values\nis recorded as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record\nadjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the\nmeasurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any\nsubsequent adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.\n84",
          "Goodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is\nallocated to reporting units expected to benefit from the business combination. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, in\nthe fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. We evaluate our\nreporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation\napproach. In testing for goodwill impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or\ncircumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying\namount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a\nreporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then additional impairment testing is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise,\nwe proceed to the quantitative assessment.\nThe quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its book value, including goodwill. If the fair\nvalue exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. However, if the book value\nof a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total\namount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Refer to Note 7 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets for further information.\nIntangible Assets, Net\nIntangible assets are carried at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from one\nto 18 years. We review definite-lived intangible assets for impairment under the long-lived asset model described in the Evaluation of\nLong-Lived Assets for Impairment section. Refer to Note 7 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets for further information.\nInvestments\nEquity Securities\nAccounting for our equity securities varies depending on the marketability of the security and the type of investment. Our\nmarketable equity securities in publicly traded companies are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. Certain investments in non-marketable equity securities are measured at cost, with\nremeasurements to fair value only upon the occurrence of observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar\nsecurities of the same issuer, or in the event of any impairment. We reassess non-marketable equity securities at each reporting period\nto determine whether they have a readily determinable fair value, in which case they would no longer be eligible for the fair value\nmeasurement alternative. Non-marketable equity securities that we elected to apply the fair value option and equity securities with a\nreadily determinable fair value are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recognized in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. We evaluate our non-marketable equity securities for impairment at each reporting period based\non a qualitative assessment that considers various potential impairment indicators. Impairment indicators might include, but would not\nnecessarily be limited to, a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, or business prospects of\nthe investee, a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, a bona fide offer\nto purchase, an offer by the investee to sell, or a completed auction process for the same or similar securities for an amount less than\nthe carrying amount of the investments in those securities. If an impairment exists, a loss is recognized in the consolidated statements\nof operations for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the investment. We include investments in equity\nsecurities within investments on the consolidated balance sheets.\nDebt Securities\nAccounting for our debt securities varies depending on the legal form of the security, our intended holding period for the security,\nand the nature of the transaction. Investments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are initially recorded at fair\nvalue. Investments in marketable debt securities may include U.S. government and agency securities, commercial paper, corporate\nbonds, and time deposits. Subsequent changes in fair value of available-for-sale debt securities are recorded in other comprehensive\nincome (loss), net of tax. We record certain of our debt securities at fair value with the changes in fair value recorded in earnings under\nthe fair value option of accounting for financial instruments.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we considered our marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those\nwith maturity dates beyond one year, and therefore classify these securities as short-term investments on the consolidated balance\nsheets.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Available-for-sale Debt Securities\nWe account for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities in accordance with ASC 326, Financial Instruments - Credit\nLosses (“ASC 326”). Under ASC 326, at each reporting period, we evaluate our available-for-sale debt securities at the individual\nsecurity level to determine whether there is a decline in the fair value below its amortized cost basis (an impairment). In circumstances\nwhere we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell, the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the\ndifference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated statements of operations, with a\ncorresponding write-down of the security’s amortized cost. In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether\na decline is due to credit-related factors. The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to\n85",
          "which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings\nactions, as well as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare the present value\nof the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the security’s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security.\nA credit-related impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for\ncredit loss on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to net income (loss). Any remaining decline in fair value\nthat is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Improvements in expected cash flows due to\nimprovements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and corresponding reduction in the allowance for credit loss.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe enter into financial derivative instruments, consisting of foreign currency contracts to mitigate the foreign currency exchange\nrisk of our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. We do not use derivatives for trading or\nspeculative purposes. These instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value and classified within Level 2 of\nthe fair value hierarchy. Gains and losses on the derivative instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments are recognized\nin other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. The cash flows associated with our non-designated\nderivatives are classified in cash flows from investing activities on our consolidated statement of cash flows.\nWe have master netting arrangements with certain counterparties to our foreign currency exchange contracts, which are designed\nto reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. We have elected to present the derivative\nassets and derivative liabilities on a gross basis. Derivative assets are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and\nderivative liabilities are recorded in accrued and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\nRestricted Investments\nAs of December 31, 2024, restricted investments on the consolidated balance sheets are comprised of marketable debt securities\nthat may include U.S. government and agency securities, commercial paper, corporate bonds, and time deposits, which are held in\ntrust accounts at third-party financial institutions pursuant to certain contracts with insurance providers. Restricted investments are\nclassified as non-current assets as these investments are unavailable for use in short-term operations due to legal and/or contractual\nrestrictions.\nEquity Method Investments\nInvestments in common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant\ninfluence, but not a controlling financial interest, over the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, unless the\nfair value option is elected. Investments accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at cost. Subsequently, we\nrecognize through the consolidated statements of operations and as an adjustment to the investment balance, our proportionate share of\nthe investees’ net income or loss and the amortization of basis differences. We record our share of the results of equity method\ninvestments one quarter in arrears as income (loss) from equity method investment, net of tax in the consolidated statements of\noperations. We evaluate each of our equity method investments at the end of each reporting period to determine whether events or\nchanges in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment may not be fully recoverable. We recognize in the\nconsolidated statements of operations and as an adjustment to the investment balance, any required impairment loss. Evidence of a\nloss in value might include, but would not necessarily be limited to, absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the\ninvestment or inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment. This\nevaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors including recent financial results and operating trends of the investee;\nimplied values in recent transactions of investee securities; other publicly available information that may affect the value of our\ninvestments.\nEvaluation of Long-Lived Assets for Impairment\nWe evaluate our held-and-used long-lived assets for indicators of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances\nindicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group (collectively, the “asset group”) may not be recoverable. We measure the\nrecoverability of the asset group by comparing the carrying amount of such asset groups to the future undiscounted cash flows it\nexpects the asset group to generate. If we consider the asset group to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount\nby which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value.\nFair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement date. In accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”), we use the\nfair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy, as defined below, gives the highest priority\nto unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three\nlevels of the fair value hierarchy are set forth below:\nLevel 1 Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n86",
          "Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets,\nquoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly\nor indirectly for the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or\nliabilities.\nOur primary financial instruments include receivables, investments in debt and equity securities, accounts payable, accrued\nliabilities, long-term debt and warrants. The estimated fair value of marketable debt securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable\nand accrued liabilities approximates their carrying value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. Refer to Note 3 –\nInvestments and Fair Value Measurement and Note 8 – Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit Arrangements for further information.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe evaluate our ownership, contractual, and other interests in entities to determine if we have a variable interest in an entity.\nThese evaluations are complex and involve judgment, estimates, and assumptions based on available historical and prospective\ninformation, among other factors. If we determine that an entity for which we hold a contractual or ownership interest in is a VIE and\nthat we are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate such entity in the consolidated financial statements. The primary beneficiary of a\nVIE is the party that meets both of the following criteria: (1) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the\neconomic performance of the VIE; and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could\npotentially be significant to the VIE. Periodically, we determine whether any changes in the interest or relationship with the entity\nimpact the determination of whether the entity is still a VIE and whether we are still the primary beneficiary. If we are not deemed to\nbe the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable\nGAAP. Refer to Note 15 – Variable Interest Entities for further information.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when or as we satisfy our obligations. We derive revenue from Drivers’ and Merchants’ use of our\nplatform, on-demand lead generation, and related services, including facilitating payments from end-users. The service enables\nDrivers and Merchants to seek, receive and fulfill on-demand requests from end-users seeking Mobility or Delivery services\n(collectively the “Uber Service”). In many of our markets, we also generate revenue from end-users. In these markets, we charge end-\nusers a direct fee for use of the platform or in exchange for Mobility or Delivery services. Additionally, we derive revenue from\ncustomers' use of Freight services.\nWe periodically reassess our revenue recognition policies as business models and other factors evolve.\nMobility and Delivery Agreements\nWe primarily enter into Master Services Agreements (“MSA”) with Drivers and Merchants to use the platform. The MSA defines\nthe service fee we charge Drivers and Merchants for each transaction. Upon acceptance of a transaction, Drivers and Merchants agree\nto perform the services as requested by an end-user. The acceptance of a transaction request combined with the MSA establishes\nenforceable rights and obligations for each transaction. A contract exists between us and the Drivers and Merchants after the Drivers\nand Merchants accept a transaction request and the Drivers’ and Merchants’ ability to cancel the transaction lapses.\nThe Uber Service activities are performed to satisfy our sole performance obligation in the transaction, which is to connect\nDrivers and Merchants with end-users to facilitate the completion of a successful transaction.\nIn markets where we are responsible for Mobility services to end-users, end-users are our customers and our sole performance\nobligation in the transaction is to provide transportation services to the end-user. In markets where we are responsible for Delivery\nservices to end-users, Merchants and end-users are our customers. In addition to our performance obligation to Merchants, our\nperformance obligation to end-users is to provide delivery services.\nIn markets where we charge Mobility and Delivery end-users a fee to use the platform, we have a performance obligation to end-\nusers to connect them to Drivers and Merchants in the marketplace.\nPrincipal vs. Agent Accounting Considerations\nJudgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users.\nWe evaluate the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and\nare the principal (i.e. “gross”), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are an agent (i.e. “net”). This\ndetermination also impacts the presentation of incentives provided to Drivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to\nend-users to the extent they are not customers.\nIn Mobility and Delivery transactions where our role is to provide the Uber Service to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a\nsuccessful trip or Delivery service, we do not control and are not primarily responsible for the good or service provided by Drivers and\nMerchants to end-users. In these transactions, Mobility and Delivery revenue is recorded on a net basis.\n87",
          "In markets where we agree to provide Mobility or Delivery services to end-users for a fee, we are primarily responsible for the\nservices and present the respective Mobility and Delivery revenue on a gross basis. Payments to Drivers and Couriers in exchange for\ntheir services are recorded as cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\nMobility\nWe derive our Mobility revenue from service fees paid by Drivers for use of the platform and related service to connect with\nRiders and successfully complete a trip via the Platform, amounts charged to end-users for Mobility services, and fees charged to end-\nusers for use of the platform in certain markets. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete.\nDepending on the market where the trip is completed, the service fee is either a fixed percentage of the end-user fare or the\ndifference between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned by Drivers. In markets where we earn the difference\nbetween the amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned by Drivers, end-users are quoted a fixed upfront price for ridesharing\nservices while we pay Drivers based on actual time and distance for the ridesharing services provided. We typically receive the service\nfee within a short period of time following the completion of a trip.\nIn certain markets, end-users have the option to pay cash for trips. Service fees for cash trips are recognized only when collected\nfrom Drivers as we concluded that collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected.\nMobility revenue also includes immaterial revenue streams such as our financial partnerships products.\nDelivery\nWe derive our Delivery revenue from service fees paid by Couriers and Merchants for use of the platform and related service to\nsuccessfully complete meal preparation, grocery and other delivery service on the platform, amounts charged to end-users for Delivery\nservices, and fees charged to end-users for use of the platform in certain markets. We recognize revenue when a Delivery transaction is\ncomplete.\nIn the majority of transactions, the service fee paid by Merchants is a fixed percentage of the meal price. The service fee paid by\nCouriers is the difference between the delivery fee amount paid by the end-user and the amount earned by the Couriers. End-users are\nquoted a fixed price for the meal delivery while we pay Couriers based on time and distance for the delivery. We typically receive the\nservice fee within a short period of time following the completion of a delivery.\nFreight\nWe derive our Freight revenue from freight brokerage, transportation management and related services provided to Shippers.\nBrokerage\nBrokerage revenue represents the gross amount of fees charged to Shippers for brokerage services provided to Shippers. Costs\nincurred with independent freight carriers for Brokerage are recorded in cost of revenue. Shippers contract with us to utilize our\nnetwork of independent freight carriers to transport freight. We enter into contracts with Shippers that define the price for each\nshipment and payment terms and our acceptance of the shipment request from Shippers establishes enforceable rights and obligations\nfor each contract. We enter into separate contracts with independent freight carriers and are responsible for payment of freight charges\nto the carrier regardless of payment by the Shipper. We invoice the Shipper upon satisfaction of our sole performance obligation to\nfacilitate the transportation of the Shipper’s freight through our network of independent freight carriers. We recognize revenue\nassociated with our performance obligation over the contract term, which represents our performance over the period of time a\nshipment is in transit. While the transit period of our contracts can vary based on origin and destination, contracts still in transit at\nperiod end are not material. Payment for our services is generally due within 30 to 45 days upon receipt of invoice.\nTransportation Management\nOur Transportation Management services can include shipment planning, freight optimization, carrier assignment, load\nmanagement, freight audit and payment processing and other Transportation Management related services. Our sole performance\nobligation in these contracts is the integration of these services that allow for the transport of the Shipper’s freight by independent\nfreight carriers. Transportation Management revenue is recognized on a gross basis in the amount of gross fees charged to Shippers\nupon satisfaction of our performance obligation. Costs incurred with independent freight carriers for these transactions are recorded in\ncost of revenue. Revenue is recognized as our performance obligation is satisfied, which generally represents the transit period from\norigin to destination by an independent freight carrier. While the transit period of our contracts can vary based on origin and\ndestination, contracts still in transit at period end are not material. Payment for our services is generally due within 30 to 60 days upon\ncompletion of our performance obligation.\nPrincipal vs. Agent Accounting Considerations\nJudgment is required in determining whether we recognize the fees charged to Shippers on a gross or net basis. We record the\nmajority of our revenue from Brokerage and Transportation Management on a gross basis at the amounts charged to Shippers as we\nare primarily responsible for facilitating the transportation of Shippers’ goods with independent freight carriers that meet the Shipper’s\nspecifications. We also have pricing discretion for the price(s) charged to Shippers and amounts paid to Carriers.\n88",
          "Advertising Revenue\nWe derive the majority of our advertising revenue from sponsored listing fees paid by Merchants and brands in exchange for\nadvertising on our platform. Advertising revenue is recognized when an end-user engages with the sponsored listing based on the\nnumber of clicks. Revenue is presented on a gross basis in the amount billed to Merchants and brands as we control the advertisement\nbefore it is transferred to the end-user.\nIncentives to Customers\nIncentives provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service or cannot\nreasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service received. Incentives to customers that are not provided in exchange for a\ndistinct good or service are evaluated as variable consideration, in the most likely amount to be earned by the customer at the time or\nas they are earned by customers, depending on the type of incentive. Since incentives are earned over a short period of time, there is\nlimited uncertainty when estimating variable consideration.\nIncentives earned by customers for referring new customers are paid in exchange for a distinct service and are accounted for as\ncustomer acquisition costs. We expense such referral payments as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated\nstatements of operations. We expense costs to acquire new customer contracts as incurred because the amortization period would be\none year or less. The amount recorded as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the incentive paid or the established fair value of\nthe service received. Fair value of the service is established using amounts paid to vendors for similar services. The amounts paid to\ncustomers presented as sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024 were immaterial.\nIn some transactions, incentives and payments made to customers may exceed the revenue earned in the transaction. In these\ntransactions, the resulting shortfall amount is recorded as a reduction of revenue.\nEnd-User Discounts and Promotions\nWe offer discounts and promotions to end-users to encourage use of our platform. These are offered in various forms of discounts\nand promotions and include:\nTargeted end-user discounts and promotions: These discounts and promotions are offered to a limited number of end-users in a\nmarket to acquire, re-engage, or generally increase end-users use of the Platform, and are akin to a coupon. An example is an offer\nproviding a discount on a limited number of rides or deliveries during a limited time period. We record the cost of these discounts and\npromotions to end-users who are not our customers as sales and marketing expenses at the time they are redeemed by the end-user.\nEnd-user referrals: These referrals are earned when an existing end-user (the referring end-user) refers a new end-user (the\nreferred end-user) to the platform and the new end-user who is not our customer completes their first transaction on the platform.\nThese referrals are typically paid in the form of a credit given to the referring end-user. These referrals are offered to attract new end-\nusers to the Platform. We record the liability for these referrals and corresponding expenses as sales and marketing expenses at the\ntime the referral is earned by the referring end-user.\nMarket-wide promotions: These promotions are pricing actions in the form of discounts that reduce the end-user fare charged by\nDrivers and Merchants to end-users who are not our customers for all or substantially all Mobility or Delivery offerings in a specific\nmarket. This also includes any discounts offered under our subscription offerings and certain discounts within the Uber Rewards\nprograms, which enable end-users to receive a fixed fare or a discount on all eligible rides. Accordingly, we record the cost of these\npromotions as a reduction of revenue at the time the transaction is completed.\nRefunds and Credits\nRefunds and credits to end-users due to end-user dissatisfaction with the Platform are recorded as sales and marketing expenses or\nas a reduction of revenue depending on whether the end-user is considered a customer based on the market. Refunds to end-users that\nwe recover from Drivers and Merchants are recorded as a reduction of revenue.\nOther\nWe have elected to exclude from revenue, taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and are concurrent\nwith specific revenue producing transactions, and collected from Drivers, Merchants and end-users and remitted to governmental\nauthorities. Accordingly, such amounts are not included as a component of revenue or cost of revenue.\nPractical Expedients\nWe have utilized the practical expedient available under ASC 606-10-50-14 and do not disclose the value of unsatisfied\nperformance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less. We have no significant financing\ncomponents in our contracts with customers.\n89",
          "Stock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation expense in accordance with the fair value recognition and measurement provisions of\nGAAP, which requires compensation cost for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite\nservice period. We account for forfeitures when they occur. The fair value of stock-based awards, granted or modified, is determined\non the grant date (or modification or acquisition dates, if applicable) at fair value, using appropriate valuation techniques. The fair\nvalue of common stock was determined on the grant date using the closing price of our common stock.\nService-Based Awards\nWe record stock-based compensation expense for service-based stock options and restricted stock units (“RSU(s)”) on a straight-\nline basis over the requisite service period, which is generally four years.\nFor stock options with service-based vesting conditions only, the valuation model, typically the Black-Scholes option-pricing\nmodel, incorporates various assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected term and risk-free interest rates. We\nestimate the volatility of common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility of our own\nshares or comparable publicly traded companies in our industry group. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield\ncurve in effect at the time of grant with a term equal to the expected term. We estimate the expected term based on the simplified\nmethod for employee stock options considered to be “plain vanilla” options, as our historical share option exercise experience does not\nprovide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. We estimate the expected term for non-employees’ options based\non the contractual term. The expected dividend yield is 0.0% as we have not paid and do not anticipate paying dividends on our\ncommon stock.\nPerformance-Based Awards\nWe have granted restricted common stock awards (“RSA(s)”), RSUs, stock appreciation rights (“SAR(s)”), and stock options that\nvest upon the satisfaction of both service-based and performance-based conditions. The service-based condition for these awards\ngenerally is satisfied over three or four years. The performance-based conditions generally are satisfied upon achieving specified\nperformance targets, such as our financial or operating metrics. We record stock-based compensation expense for performance-based\nequity awards such as RSAs, RSUs, SARs, and stock options on an accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period,\nwhich is generally three or four years, and only if performance-based conditions are considered probable to be satisfied.\nFor performance-based awards and RSUs, we determine the grant-date fair value to be the fair value of our common stock on the\ngrant date.\nFor performance-based SARs, stock options, and warrants, we determine the grant-date fair value utilizing the valuation model as\ndescribed above for service-based awards.\nMarket-Based Awards\nWe have granted RSUs and stock options that vest only upon the satisfaction of the following conditions: service-based\nconditions, performance-based conditions, and/or market-based conditions. The service-based condition for these awards generally is\nsatisfied over three or four years. The performance-based conditions generally are satisfied upon achieving specified performance\ntargets. The market-based conditions are satisfied upon our achievement of specified fully-diluted equity values, as determined based\non our stock price.\nFor market-based awards, we determine the grant-date fair value utilizing a Monte Carlo valuation model, which incorporates\nvarious assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected term, and risk-free interest rates. We estimate the volatility of\ncommon stock on the date of grant based on historical volatility of Uber’s stock price. We estimate the expected term based on various\nexercise scenarios. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\nWe record stock-based compensation expense for market-based equity awards such as RSUs and stock options on an accelerated\nattribution method over the requisite service period, and only if performance-based conditions are considered probable to be satisfied.\nWe determine the requisite service period by comparing the derived service period to achieve the market-based condition and the\nexplicit service-based period, using the longer of the two service periods as the requisite service period.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)\nWe recognize stock-based expenses related to shares issued pursuant to our ESPP on a straight-line basis over the offering period.\nThe ESPP provides for twelve-month offering periods, and each offering period includes two purchase periods of approximately six\nmonths. The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at a 15 percent discount on the lower price of\neither (i) the offering period begin date or (ii) the purchase date. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under the ESPP\nbased on a combination of options valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We determine volatility over an expected\nterm of six months and twelve months based on our historical volatility. We estimate the expected term based on the contractual term.\n90",
          "Income Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and\nliabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe account for uncertainty in tax positions recognized in the consolidated financial statements by recognizing a tax benefit from\nan uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of\nany related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not\nrecognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized.\nWe recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for (benefit from) income taxes\nin the consolidated statements of operations.\nValuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more-likely-than-not\nexpected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately\ndepends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain)\nwithin the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. We regularly review the deferred tax assets for\nrecoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, excess tax benefits related to stock-based\ncompensation, the expected timing of the reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment\nregarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully\nexecute our business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our\nincome tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. We elected the tax law ordering\napproach in assessing the realizability of net operating losses expected to offset future Global Intangible Low-taxed Income\n(“GILTI”).\nWe have elected to treat any potential GILTI inclusions as a period cost.\nThe establishment of deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers of intangible assets requires management to make significant\nestimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of such intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may\ninclude, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue and expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets,\ncomparable transaction values, and/or discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value\nare derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow.\nAlthough we believe the assumptions and estimates utilized are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical\nexperience, internal and external comparable data and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur\nthat could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\nCosts and Expenses\nSet forth below is a brief description of the components of our expenses:\n• Cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily consists of costs incurred for certain Mobility and\nDelivery transactions where we are primarily responsible for Mobility and Delivery services and pay Drivers and Couriers\nfor services, certain insurance costs related to our Mobility and Delivery offerings, costs incurred with Carriers for Uber\nFreight transportation services, credit card processing fees, bank fees, data center and networking expenses, mobile device\nand service costs, and amounts related to fare chargebacks and other credit card losses.\n• Operations and support expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for\nemployees that support operations in cities, including the general managers, Driver operations, platform user support\nrepresentatives and community managers. Also included is the cost of customer support, Driver background checks and the\nallocation of certain corporate costs.\n• Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of advertising costs, product marketing costs, discounts, loyalty programs,\npromotions, refunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers, compensation costs, including stock-based\ncompensation to sales and marketing employees, and the allocation of certain corporate costs. We expense advertising and\nother promotional expenditures as incurred. Advertising expenses totaled $1.7 billion for each of the years ended December\n31, 2022 and 2023 and $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024. Discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds,\nand credits provided to end-users who are not customers totaled $2.2 billion, $1.7 billion, and $1.4 billion for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively.\n• Research and development expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for\nemployees in engineering, design and product development. Expenses also include ongoing improvements to, and\nmaintenance of, existing products and services, and allocation of certain corporate costs.\n• General and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for\nexecutive management and administrative employees, including finance and accounting, human resources, policy and\ncommunications, legal, and certain impairment charges, as well as allocation of certain corporate costs, occupancy, and\n91",
          "general corporate insurance costs. General and administrative expenses also include certain legal related accruals and\nexpenses.\n• Depreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation on buildings, site improvements, computer and\nnetwork equipment, software, leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and amortization of intangible assets.\nRestructuring and Related Charges\nCosts associated with management-approved restructuring activities, including reductions in headcount, exiting a market or\nconsolidation of facilities are recognized when they are incurred and may include employee termination benefits, impairment of long-\nlived assets (including impairment of operating lease right-of-use assets), contract termination costs and accelerated lease cost for\nright-of-use assets that ceased to be used. We record a liability for employee termination benefits either when it is probable that an\nemployee is entitled to them and the amount of the benefits can be reasonably estimated or when management has communicated the\ntermination plan to employees and all of the following conditions have been met: management, having the authority to approve the\naction, commits to a plan of termination; the plan identifies the number of employees to be terminated, their job classifications and\ntheir locations, and the expected completion date; the plan establishes the terms of the benefit arrangement in sufficient detail to\nenable employees to determine the type and amount of benefits they will receive if they are involuntarily terminated; and actions\nrequired to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be\nwithdrawn. We accrue for costs to terminate contracts other than a lease when we terminate the contract in accordance with the\ncontract terms. Costs that will continue to be incurred for the remaining term of a contract that is not a lease, and provide no economic\nbenefits to us are recognized at the cease-use date. Costs associated with lease contracts are accounted for under the leasing\naccounting guidance or under the long-lived assets accounting guidance.\nRestructuring and related charges are recognized as an operating expense within the consolidated statements of operations and are\nclassified based on our classification policy for each category of operating expense. Personnel costs are classified based on each\nemployee’s classification, lease costs (including impairments of right-of-use assets) are classified in the same expense line item where\neach lease’s rent expense was recognized and impairment of other long-lived assets are recorded within general and administrative\nexpenses.\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency or U.S. dollar depending on the nature of the subsidiaries’\nactivities. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured to the functional\ncurrency at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period. Gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are recorded in foreign\nexchange gains (losses), net within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Subsidiary assets and\nliabilities with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are translated at the month-end rate, retained earnings and other equity items are\ntranslated at historical rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year. Cumulative\ntranslation adjustments are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of total equity\n(deficit).\nNet Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nWe compute net income (loss) per share using the two-class method required for participating securities. The two-class method\nrequires income available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities\nbased upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed.\nOur restricted common stock, and common stock issued upon early exercise of stock options are participating securities. We\nconsider restricted common stock and any shares issued upon early exercise of stock options, subject to repurchase, to be participating\nsecurities because holders of such shares have non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event a cash dividend is declared on common\nstock.\nInsurance Reserves\nWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance\nsubsidiary, to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks, including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto\nphysical damage, general liability, and workers’ compensation. Insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment\nexpenses, which represents the estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for such insurance related risks and includes an amount for\ncase reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of\nthe ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience. In\naddition, we use assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs,\nwhich consider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data. These reserves are continually reviewed and adjusted as\nexperience develops and new information becomes known. Adjustments to reserves for risks retained by us, if any, relating to\naccidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations. Reserve amounts estimated to be settled\nwithin one year are recorded in short-term insurance reserves, with longer term settlements recorded in long-term insurance reserves\non the consolidated balance sheets. Insurance recoverables are recognized when we enter into contracts that transfer the risk recorded\n92",
          "in our insurance reserves to third-party insurance companies. Recoverable amounts estimated to be recovered within one year are\nrecorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets, with longer term recoverables recorded in other assets on the consolidated\nbalance sheets.\nWhile management believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than,\nthe amount provided. All estimates of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserves, are subject to\ninherent variability caused by the nature of the insurance claim settlement process. Such variability is increased for us due to limited\nhistorical experience and the nature of the coverage provided. Actual results depend upon the outcome of future contingent events and\ncan be affected by many factors, such as claims settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal, and social environments. As\na result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability and when these amounts will be paid may vary from the\nestimate provided on the consolidated balance sheets.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, indirect tax examinations or government inquiries and investigations\nthat may arise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate\namounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be\nreasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we\ndisclose the possible loss in the consolidated financial statements.\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously\nrecorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our\ndisclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\nSignificant judgment is required to determine both the probability and the estimated amount of loss.\nThe outcomes of litigation, indirect tax examinations and investigations are inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of\nthese matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations, financial\ncondition, or cash flows, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could\nbe materially adversely affected.\nWe recognize estimated losses from contingencies that relate to proceedings in which Drivers are the plaintiffs, or proceedings\nand regulatory penalties against Drivers for which we elect to either pay on behalf of or reimburse Drivers, as a reduction of revenue\nin the consolidated statements of operations. All other estimated losses from contingencies are recognized in general and\nadministrative expenses.\nLegal fees and other costs associated with such actions are expensed as incurred.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2022-03, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820):\nFair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions,” which clarifies that contractual sale restrictions\nare not considered in measuring fair value of equity securities and requires additional disclosures for equity securities subject to\ncontractual sale restrictions. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. We\nadopted the ASU on January 1, 2024. The additional required disclosures did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment\nDisclosures,” which adds required disclosures of significant expenses for each reportable segment, as well as certain other disclosures\nto help investors understand how the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) evaluates segment expenses and operating results.\nThe new standard also allows disclosure of multiple measures of segment profitability, if those measures are used to allocate resources\nand assess performance. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and\ninterim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We adopted the new standard on January 1, 2024 on a\nretrospective basis. Refer to Note 13 – Segment Information and Geographic Information for further information.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,”\nwhich requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income\ntaxes paid. The standard is intended to benefit investors by providing more detailed income tax disclosures that would be useful in\nmaking capital allocation decisions. The standard will be effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15,\n2024. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated\nfinancial statements and related disclosures.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, \"Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense\nDisaggregation Disclosures,\" which requires disclosure of additional information about specific expense categories underlying certain\nincome statement expense line items. The standard will be effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December\n93",
          "15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently\nevaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nNote 2 – Revenue\nThe following tables present our revenues disaggregated by offering and geographical region. Revenue by geographical region is\nbased on where the transaction occurred. This level of disaggregation takes into consideration how the nature, amount, timing, and\nuncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2023 2024\nMobility revenue (1) $ 14,029 $ 19,832 $ 25,087\nDelivery revenue (1) 10,901 12,204 13,750\nFreight revenue 6,947 5,245 5,141\nTotal revenue $ 31,877 $ 37,281 $ 43,978\n(1) We offer subscription memberships to end-users including Uber One, Uber Pass, Rides Pass, and Eats Pass (“Subscription”).\nWe recognize Subscription fees ratably over the life of the pass.

We did not record any material\nunrealized gains or losses as of December 31, 2023.\nThe following table summarizes the amortized cost, unrealized gains and losses, and fair value of our debt securities (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2024\nAmortized Cost Unrealized Gains Unrealized Losses Fair Value\nU.S. government and agency securities $ 5,843 $ 7 $ (2) $ 5,848\nCommercial paper 702 — — 702\nCorporate bonds 1,975 1 (2) 1,974\nCertificates of deposit 38 — — 38\nTotal $ 8,558 $ 8 $ (4) $ 8,562\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, we did not record any material realized gains or losses for our debt\nsecurities.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2024, there were no allowance for credit losses related to our debt securities. The weighted-average\nremaining maturity of our debt securities was less than one year as of December 31, 2024.\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments\nAs of December 31, 2024, the fair value of our outstanding derivative assets and liabilities were not material. We did not record\nany material realized or unrealized gains or losses for our financial derivative instruments during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2024, there were no rights of set-off associated with our foreign currency exchange contracts.\nThe total notional amount of outstanding derivatives not designated as hedging instruments was $1.1 billion as of December 31,\n2024.\nFair Value Hierarchy\nWe measure our cash equivalents and certain investments at fair value. Level 1 instrument valuations are based on quoted market\nprices of the identical underlying security. Level 2 instrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for\ncomparable instruments, identical instruments in less active markets, or models using market observable inputs. Level 3 instrument\nvaluations are valued based on unobservable inputs and other estimation techniques due to the absence of quoted market prices,\ninherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such financial instruments.\n96",
          "As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, our Level 3 non-marketable equity securities and note receivable from a related party\nprimarily consist of common stock investments and convertible secured notes that may be converted into common or preferred stock\nin privately held companies without readily determinable fair values.\nDepending on the investee’s financing activity in a reporting period, management’s estimate of fair value may be primarily\nderived from the investee’s financing transactions, such as the issuance of preferred stock to new investors. The price in these\ntransactions generally provides the best indication of the enterprise value of the investee. Additionally, based on the timing, volume,\nand other characteristics of the transaction, we may supplement this information by using other valuation techniques, including the\nguideline public company approach. The guideline public company approach relies on publicly available market data of comparable\ncompanies and uses comparative valuation multiples of the investee’s revenue (actual and forecasted), and therefore, unobservable\ninput used in this valuation technique primarily consists of short-term revenue projections.\nOnce the fair value of the investee is estimated, an option-pricing model (“OPM”), a common stock equivalent (“CSE”) method\nor a hybrid approach is employed to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us. The\nmodel involves making assumptions around the investees’ expected time to liquidity and volatility.\nAn increase or decrease in any of the unobservable inputs in isolation, such as the security price in a significant financing\ntransaction of the investee, could result in a material increase or decrease in our estimate of fair value. Other unobservable inputs,\nincluding short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, and volatility are less sensitive to the valuation in the respective reporting\nperiods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee’s financing transactions. In the future, depending on the weight of\nevidence and valuation approaches used, these or other inputs may have a more significant impact on our estimate of fair value.\nWe determine realized gains or losses on the sale of equity and debt securities on a specific identification method.\nZomato Investment\nDuring the third quarter of 2022, we completed the sale of $418 million of our entire stake in Zomato ordinary shares for net\nproceeds of $376 million and recognized an immaterial loss from this transaction in other income (expense), net in our consolidated\nstatement of operations.\nAurora Investment\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2024, our Class A common stock in Aurora (“Aurora Investment”) have been classified as a\nmarketable equity security with a readily determinable fair value (Level 1) in the table presenting our financial assets measured at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis.

Such fair value measurements are based predominately on Level 3 inputs.\nNon-Marketable Equity Securities\nOur non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values. The\ncarrying value of our non-marketable equity securities are adjusted based on price changes from observable transactions of identical or\nsimilar securities of the same issuer (referred to as the measurement alternative) or for impairment. Any changes in carrying value are\nrecorded within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Non-marketable equity securities are\nclassified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the fair value of these securities based on valuation methods,\nincluding the CSE and OPM methods, using the transaction price of similar securities issued by the investee adjusted for contractual\nrights and obligations of the securities we hold.\nThe following is a summary of unrealized gains and losses from remeasurement (referred to as upward or downward adjustments)\nrecorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations, and included as adjustments to the carrying value\nof non-marketable equity securities held during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024 based on the observable price in\nan orderly transaction for the same or similar security of the same issuers (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2023 2024\nUpward adjustments $ 1,046 $ 908 $ 657\nDownward adjustments (including impairment) (641) (472) (328)\nTotal unrealized gain (loss) for non-marketable equity securities $ 405 $ 436 $ 329\nThe following table summarizes the total carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities measured at fair value on a non-\nrecurring basis held, including cumulative unrealized upward and downward adjustments made to the initial cost basis of the securities\n(in millions):\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2024\nInitial cost basis $ 1,727 $ 2,030\nUpward adjustments 1,960 2,611\nDownward adjustments (including impairment) (1,113) (1,442)\nTotal carrying value at the end of the period $ 2,574 $ 3,199\nWe did not record any realized gains or losses for our non-marketable equity securities measured at fair value on a non-recurring\nbasis during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024.\nDidi Investment\nIn the second quarter of 2022, Didi completed their delisting from the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE Delisting”). We\nconcluded the ordinary shares held by us did not have a readily determinable fair value and should be accounted for under the\nmeasurement alternative method. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, Didi American Depositary Shares (“ADS”) continue to be\ntraded in the over-the-counter (“OTC”) market. We determined that the Didi ADS were similar to the ordinary shares held prior to the\nNYSE Delisting. We then measured the investment to fair value based on the closing share price of the Didi ADS on the OTC market\non December 31, 2023 and 2024 as an observable transaction for similar securities. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, our Didi\ninvestment is classified as a non-marketable equity security and is measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis with a readily\navailable price based on significant other observable inputs (Level 2).

Careem Technologies is considered a related party to us upon the closing of the transaction. We continue to fully\nown the ridesharing business of Careem.\nUpon closing of the transaction, we recognized a gain of approximately $204 million during the fourth quarter of 2023, in other\nincome (expense), net on our consolidated statement of operations. Additionally, we received two seats on Careem Technologies’\nboard and retained an approximately 42% equity ownership interest consisting of common stock in Careem Technologies. The initial\nfair value of our equity method investment in Careem Technologies was $300 million. The investment was determined to be an equity\nmethod investment due to our ability to exercise significant influence over Careem Technologies.\nIncluded in the initial carrying value of $300 million was a basis difference related to the difference between the cost of the\ninvestment and our proportionate share of the net assets of Careem Technologies. As of December 31, 2024, this basis difference was\nnot material. The carrying value of the equity method investment is adjusted for our share in the income or losses of Careem\nTechnologies on a one-quarter lag basis and amortization of basis differences.\nWe amortize the basis difference related to the intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the assets that gave rise to the\ndifference using the straight-line method. Equity method goodwill is not amortized.\nMLU B.V. Investment\nDuring 2018, we closed a transaction that contributed the net assets of our Uber Russia/CIS operations into a newly formed\nprivate limited liability company (“MLU B.V.” or “Yandex.Taxi joint venture”), with Yandex N.V (“Yandex”) and us holding\nownership interests in MLU B.V. In exchange for consideration contributed, we received a seat on MLU B.V.’s board and an initial\n38% equity ownership interest consisting of common stock in MLU B.V. The investment was determined to be an equity method\ninvestment due to our ability to exercise significant influence over MLU B.V.\nWe review for impairment whenever factors indicate that the carrying value of the equity method investment may not be\nrecoverable. During the first quarter of 2022, we determined that our investment in MLU B.V. was other-than-temporarily impaired,\nand recorded an impairment charge of $182 million in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations. The\nimpairment was primarily due to consensus projections of a protracted recession of the Russian economy as a result of Russia's\ninvasion of Ukraine. To determine the fair value of our investment in MLU B.V., we utilized a market approach referencing revenue\nmultiples from publicly traded peer companies.\n2023\nSale of Our Remaining Interest in MLU B.V.\nOn April 21, 2023, we entered into and closed on a definitive agreement to sell our remaining 29% equity interest in MLU B.V. to\nYandex for $703 million in cash and recognized an immaterial loss from this transaction recorded in other income (expense), net in\nour consolidated statement of operations during the year ended December 31, 2023. After this transaction, we no longer had an equity\ninterest in MLU B.V.\nMLU B.V. Call Option\nIn 2021, we granted Yandex an option (“MLU B.V. Call Option”) to acquire our remaining equity interest in MLU B.V. The MLU\nB.V. Call Option was recorded as a liability in accrued and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, initially valued\nat $230 million and measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net in\nthe consolidated statements of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option was $2 million. We recorded a $191 million net gain for\n99",

Call Option as of\nDecember 31, 2022, we used a lattice model which simulated multiple scenarios of the exercise behaviors and the corresponding strike\nprices over the term of the call option. Key inputs to the lattice model were: the underlying business value; option term of 0.7 years;\nvolatility of 65%; risk-free interest rates; and strike price (Level 3).\nAs part of our sale of our remaining interest in MLU B.V. to Yandex during the second quarter of 2023, the MLU B.V.

On March 3, 2023, we entered into a refinancing transaction under which we borrowed $1.75 billion (“First Closing”), the\nproceeds of which were used to repay in full the outstanding 2025 Refinanced Term Loan of $1.4 billion and $317 million of the\noutstanding 2027 Refinanced Term Loan. On March 14, 2023, we entered into the second refinancing transaction under which we\nborrowed $761 million (“Second Closing”), the proceeds of which were used to repay in full the outstanding 2027 Refinanced Term\nLoan. The Second Closing constituted an additional term loan in the same tranche as the First Closing (collectively, the “2030\nRefinanced Term Loans”).\nThe 2030 Refinanced Term Loans had a maturity date of March 3, 2030. The interest rate for the 2030 Refinanced Term Loans\nwas Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) subject to a floor of 0.00%, plus 2.75% per annum.

The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $1.70 billion, after\ndeducting the debt issuance costs. We used a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to fund the cost of entering into the capped\ncall transactions, described below. Additionally, we used a portion of the net proceeds from this offering, along with cash on hand, to\npartially pay down $500 million of our 2030 Refinanced Term Loans in November 2023 and redeem all of our outstanding 2025\nSenior Note in December 2023.

Pursuant to the automatic increase\nfeature of the 2019 Plan, our board of directors approved an increase of 105 million shares reserved for issuance effective January\n1, 2025, for a total of 545 million shares reserved.\nStock Option and SAR Activity\nA summary of stock option and SAR activity for the year ended December 31, 2024 is as follows (in millions, except share\namounts which are reflected in thousands, per share amounts, and years):\nWeighted-\nSARs Options Weighted- Average\nOutstanding Outstanding Average Remaining\nNumber of Number of Exercise Price Contractual Aggregate\nSARs Shares Per Share Life (in years) Intrinsic Value\nAs of December 31, 2023 123 12,641 $ 20.03 2.79 $ 535\nGranted — 3,009 $ 62.72\nExercised (90) (7,909) $ 16.90\nCanceled and forfeited — (543) $ 32.19\nAs of December 31, 2024 33 7,198 $ 40.16 4.90 $ 153\nExercisable as of December 31, 2024 33 3,484 $ 22.03 3.16 $ 135\nThe total intrinsic value of stock options and SARs exercised for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, was\n$101 million, $319 million, and $433 million respectively.\nRSU Activity\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to our RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2024 (in thousands, except\nper share amounts):\nWeighted-Average\nGrant-Date Fair\nNumber of Shares Value per Share\nUnvested and outstanding as of December 31, 2023 90,827 $ 34.49\nGranted 28,750 $ 74.87\nVested (43,285) $ 38.76\nCanceled and forfeited (10,090) $ 40.89\nUnvested and outstanding as of December 31, 2024 66,202 $ 48.49\n111",

Vesting\nof this stock may be dependent on a combination of service and performance conditions that become satisfied upon the\noccurrence of a qualifying event. We have the right to repurchase shares for which the vesting conditions are not satisfied. During\n2024, activity related to Uber’s restricted common stock was not material.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nStock-based compensation expense is allocated based on the cost center to which the award holder belongs. The following\ntable summarizes total stock-based compensation expense by function for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024 (in\nmillions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2023 2024\nOperations and support $ 154 $ 184 $ 218\nSales and marketing 102 96 91\nResearch and development 1,060 1,215 1,104\nGeneral and administrative 477 440 383\nTotal $ 1,793 $ 1,935 $ 1,796\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, we modified the terms of stock-based awards for certain\nemployees upon their termination or change in employment status. Incremental stock-based compensation cost in relation to the\nmodification of stock-based awards was not material for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2024, there was $3.1 billion of unamortized compensation costs related to all unvested awards. The\nunamortized compensation costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.58 years.\nStock-based compensation expense capitalized as internally developed software costs were not material for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024.\nOur income tax benefits recognized in the consolidated statements of operations from stock-based compensation\narrangements were not material while we were under full valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets during the years\nended December 31, 2022 and 2023. With the release of the valuation allowance associated with our U.S. federal and certain state\ndeferred tax assets in 2024, income tax benefits recognized in the consolidated statement of operations from stock-based\ncompensation expense were $381 million during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nDuring 2022, 2023 and 2024, warrants vested to non-employee service providers and others were not material and no\nwarrants were granted.\nThe weighted-average grant-date fair values of stock options and SARs granted to employees in the years ended December\n31, 2022, 2023 and 2024 were $13.58, $16.63 and $25.97 per share, respectively. During 2022, 2023 and 2024, stock options and\nSARs granted were not material.\nPerformance awards with market-based targets granted in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024 were not\nmaterial.\n2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe number of shares of Uber common stock available for issuance under the ESPP automatically increases on January 1 of\neach year, beginning in 2020 and continuing through 2029, by the lesser of (a) 1.0% of the total number of shares of common\nstock outstanding on December 31 of the immediately preceding calendar year, and (b) 25,000,000 shares. However, our board of\ndirectors or compensation committee may reduce the amount of the increase in any particular year. Pursuant to the automatic\nincrease feature of the ESPP, effective January 1, 2025, a total of 118 million shares of common stock are reserved for issuance\nunder the ESPP.\nThe stock-based compensation expense recognized for the ESPP was not material during the years ended December 31, 2022,\n2023 and 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we purchased 4 million shares of common stock under the ESPP at a\nweighted-average price of $39.95 per share. As of December 31, 2024, total unrecognized compensation cost related to the ESPP\nwas $31 million, which will be amortized over a period of 0.66 years.\nShare Repurchase Authorization\n112",
          "In February 2024, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $7.0 billion in shares of our outstanding common\nstock (the “Share Repurchase Program”). The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases are determined by the\ndiscretion of management, depending on market conditions and other factors. Repurchases may be made through open market\npurchases and accelerated share repurchases. The exact number of shares to be repurchased by us, if any, is not guaranteed.\nDepending on market conditions and other factors, these repurchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or periodically\nwithout prior notice.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased and subsequently retired 17.8 million shares of common stock for\n$1.2 billion, excluding broker commissions and fees. As of December 31, 2024, we had $5.8 billion available to repurchase shares\npursuant to the Share Repurchase Program.\nIn January 2025, we announced that we entered into an accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreement with a large\nfinancial institution to repurchase $1.5 billion of our outstanding common stock as part of our previously announced Share\nRepurchase Program. The transactions under the ASR agreement were completed during the first quarter of 2025.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act imposed a nondeductible 1% excise tax on the net value of certain stock repurchases. During the\nyear ended December 31, 2024, the excise tax on net share repurchases was not material.\n113",

          "(2) In the fourth quarter of 2022, we transferred certain intangible assets among our wholly-owned subsidiaries to align our\nstructure to our evolving operations. The transfer resulted in a net reduction in deferred tax assets of $1.7 billion; however,\nthere was no financial statement expense recognized since the deferred tax asset was offset by a full valuation allowance.\n(3) In 2024, we released $5.2 billion of our valuation allowance on our U.S. federal deferred tax assets. This is included on the\nchange in valuation allowance line-item.\nThe components of deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2023 and 2024 are as follows (in millions):\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2024\nDeferred tax assets\nNet operating loss carryforwards $ 6,164 $ 4,319\nResearch and development credits 1,275 1,539\nStock-based compensation 66 71\nAccruals and reserves 440 730\nAccrued legal 120 221\nFixed assets and intangible assets 4,135 3,500\nLease liability 436 391\nInterest limitation carryforwards 876 760\nCapitalized research expenses 771 1,317\nOther 211 381\nTotal deferred tax assets 14,494 13,229\nLess: Valuation allowance (13,945) (6,267)\nTotal deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance 549 6,962\nDeferred tax liabilities\nInvestments 114 515\nROU assets 301 270\nOther 18 14\nTotal deferred tax liabilities 433 799\nNet deferred tax assets (liabilities) $ 116 $ 6,163\nThe income tax benefit was $5.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes a $6.4 billion benefit related to the\nrelease of our valuation allowance on the U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, with the exception of our California R&D credits\nand other non-material deferred tax assets.\nWe regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. In making that assessment, we consider\nboth positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets to determine, based on the weight\nof all available evidence, whether it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we demonstrated sustained profitability in the U.S. based on U.S. pre-tax book income adjusted for\npermanent book-to-tax differences. Further, given our taxable income position for the annual period ended on December 31, 2024, we\nutilized more attributes than we generated, which reduces our U.S. federal and state net deferred tax assets. This information is both\nobjective and verifiable; thereby, representing strong positive evidence that carries significant weight.\nBased on all available positive and negative evidence, including the objective and verifiable positive evidence as described above\nand anticipated future earnings, we concluded it is more-likely-than-not that a majority of our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets\nwill be realizable. We continue to maintain a valuation allowance against the California R&D credits, as we believe it is not more-\nlikely-than-not to be realized, as we expect R&D tax credit generation to exceed our ability to use these credits in future periods.\nFurthermore, based on available evidence, we believe it is more-likely-than-not that the Netherlands’ net deferred tax assets will\nnot be fully realizable. We will continue to maintain a valuation allowance against these net deferred tax assets. We regularly review\nthe deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of\nthe reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies by jurisdiction.\nBased on our assessment of current income and anticipated future earnings, there is a reasonable possibility that we will have\nsufficient evidence to release a significant portion of the valuation allowance in the Netherlands within the next 12 months. However,\nour judgment regarding future earnings and the exact timing and amount of any valuation allowance release are subject to change due\nto many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and/or tax planning\n115",
          "strategies. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of net deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance\nsheet and would result in an income tax benefit in the period the release is recorded.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of $176 million that begin to expire in 2031 and $8.2 billion\nthat have an unlimited carryover period. As of December 31, 2024, we had U.S. state NOL carryforwards of $7.5 billion that started\nexpiring in 2024 and $1.6 billion that have an unlimited carryover period. As of December 31, 2024, we had foreign NOL\ncarryforwards of $759 million that begin to expire in 2024 and $19.2 billion that have an unlimited carryover period.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had U.S. federal research tax credit carryforwards of $1.2 billion that begin to expire in 2028. We\nhad U.S. state research tax credit carryforwards of $798 million that have an unlimited carryover period.\nIn the event we experience an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”), our\nability to utilize net operating losses, tax credits and other tax attributes may be limited. The most recent analysis of our historical\nownership changes was completed through December 31, 2024. Based on the analysis, we do not anticipate a current limitation on the\ntax attributes.\nThe following table reflects changes in gross unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2023 2024\nUnrecognized tax benefits at beginning of year $ 2,657 $ 3,513 $ 3,345\nGross increases - current year tax positions 814 177 201\nGross increases - prior year tax positions (1) 93 42 1,437\nGross decreases - prior year tax positions (51) (315) (37)\nGross decreases - settlements with tax authorities — — (6)\nGross decreases - lapse of statute of limitations — (72) (3)\nUnrecognized tax benefits at end of year $ 3,513 $ 3,345 $ 4,937\n(1) In 2024, new information became available that required a remeasurement of a prior year transfer pricing tax position\nresulting in an overall reduction in our net deferred tax assets of $1.2 billion, which is fully offset by a change in the\nvaluation allowance. This is reflected in the increases to prior year uncertain tax positions above.\nAs of December 31, 2024, approximately $421 million of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact the effective tax\nrate. The remaining $4.5 billion of the unrecognized tax benefits would not impact the effective tax rate due to the valuation allowance\nagainst certain deferred tax assets.\nWe recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the amount of interest and penalties accrued was $17\nmillion and $17 million, respectively.\nGiven the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to\nestimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. An estimate of changes to\nunrecognized tax benefits recorded as of December 31, 2024, that are reasonably possible to occur within the next 12 months cannot\nbe made.\nWe are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are also under various state and other foreign\nincome tax examinations. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in these jurisdictions. To the extent we have tax\nattribute carryforwards, the tax years in which the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the federal, state\nor foreign tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the open tax years for our major tax jurisdictions are as follows:\nJurisdiction Tax Years\nU.S. Federal 2011 - 2024\nU.S. States 2008 - 2024\nAustralia 2019 - 2024\nNetherlands 2019 - 2024\nUnited Kingdom 2022 - 2024\nAs of December 31, 2024, the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on the undistributed earnings from certain foreign\nsubsidiaries that we intend to indefinitely reinvest is not material.\nNote 12 – Net Income (Loss) Per Share\n116",

As of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2024, we had recorded aggregate liabilities of $1.0 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, of which\n$336 million and $221 million, respectively, relate to non-income tax matters in accrued and other current liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets for all of our legal, regulatory and non-income tax matters that were probable and reasonably estimable.\nWe are currently party to various legal and regulatory matters that have arisen in the normal course of business and include,\namong others, alleged independent contractor misclassification claims, Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) claims, alleged\nbackground check violations, pricing and advertising claims, unfair competition claims, intellectual property claims, employment\ndiscrimination and other employment-related claims, Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) claims, data and privacy claims,\nsecurities claims, antitrust claims, challenges to regulations, and other matters. We have existing litigation, including class actions,\nPrivate Attorney General Act lawsuits, arbitration claims, and governmental administrative and audit proceedings, asserting claims by\nor on behalf of Drivers that Drivers are misclassified as independent contractors. In connection with the enactment of California State\nAssembly Bill 5 (“AB5”), we have received and expect to continue to receive - in California and in other jurisdictions - an increased\nnumber of misclassification claims. With respect to our outstanding legal and regulatory matters, based on our current knowledge, we\nbelieve that the ultimate amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The outcome of such legal matters is inherently\nunpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of\nmanagement's expectations, our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nDriver Classification\nCalifornia Attorney General Lawsuit\nIn January 2020, AB5 went into effect. AB5 codifies a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law.\nThe test is referred to as the “ABC” test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v.\nSuperior Court in 2018. Under the ABC test, workers performing services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the\nhiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring entity’s control, (B) performs work that is outside the\nusual course of the hiring entity’s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work or type of business performed\nfor the hiring entity.\nOn May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San\nDiego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc. (“Lyft”). The complaint alleges drivers are\nmisclassified, and seeks an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged\nmisclassification of drivers.\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order, prohibiting us from classifying drivers as independent\ncontractors and from violating various wage and hour laws. The injunction was stayed pending appeal. On October 22, 2020, the\nCourt of Appeal affirmed the lower court’s ruling, and we filed a petition for review of the decision with the California Supreme\nCourt. The petition was based upon the passage of Proposition 22 by California voters in November 2020, and requested that the Court\nof Appeal opinion be vacated because AB5’s application to Uber was superseded by Proposition 22.\nProposition 22 was a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours to qualify as\nindependent workers. As a result of the passage of Proposition 22, Drivers are able to maintain their status as independent contractors\nunder California law, and we and our competitors are required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Proposition 22 went\ninto effect on December 16, 2020.\nThe California Supreme Court declined the petition for review on February 10, 2021. The lawsuit was returned to the trial court\nfollowing the appellate proceedings on February 22, 2021. On April 12, 2021, the California Attorney General, Uber and Lyft filed a\nstipulation to dissolve the preliminary injunction with the trial court. On April 16, 2021, the trial court signed an order granting the\nstipulation. Although the preliminary injunction has been dissolved, the lawsuit remains ongoing relating to claims by the California\nAttorney General for periods prior to enactment of Proposition 22. The parties petitioned to stay this matter pending coordination with\nother California employment related matters, which was granted and a coordination judge was assigned. The case had been stayed\n121",
          "pending appeal of the denial of a motion to compel arbitration, however the California Supreme Court denied review on January 17,\n2024, and the case was remitted back to the Superior Court on January 29, 2024 for further proceedings. On July 2, 2024, the Superior\nCourt lifted the stay. We intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves. The ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain and\nthe amount accrued is recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024.\nMassachusetts Attorney General Lawsuit\nOn July 9, 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint in Suffolk County Superior Court against Uber and Lyft.\nThe complaint alleges Drivers are employees, and are entitled to protections under the wage and labor laws. On June 27, 2024, the\nparties reached an agreement to resolve the matter, and the case was dismissed the same day. In October 2024, we paid into a\nsettlement fund and resolved the matter.\nSwiss Social Security Rulings\nSeveral Swiss administrative bodies have issued decisions in which they classify Drivers or Couriers as employees of Uber for\nsocial security or labor purposes. We are challenging each of them before the Social Security and Administrative Tribunals.\nOn March 21, 2023, the Federal Tribunal ruled that Drivers who have used the Uber App in 2014 qualify as employees for social\nsecurity purposes. The litigations with regards to the social security contributions are still pending for years 2014 to 2021. In October\n2024, the Social Security authority decided that the changes to our 2023 model are not sufficient to classify drivers as independent\ncontractors. We have filed an appeal against this decision.\nOn June 3, 2022, the Federal Tribunal issued two rulings by which both Drivers and Couriers in the Canton of Geneva are\nclassified as employees of Uber B.V., Uber Portier B.V. and Uber Switzerland GmbH. Following the ruling of the Federal Tribunal on\nEats, the Social Security authorities claimed the payment of social security contributions since the launch of Uber Eats. We reached a\nsettlement with the Canton of Geneva on Mobility with regards to social security implications.\nThe ultimate resolution of the matters before the social security authorities is uncertain and the amount accrued for those matters\nis recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024.\nOther Driver Classification Matters\nAdditionally, we have received other lawsuits and governmental inquiries in other jurisdictions, and anticipate future claims,\nlawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, and government investigations and audits challenging our classification of\nDrivers as independent contractors and not employees. We believe that our current and historical approach to classification is\nsupported by the law and intend to continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. However, the results of litigation and\narbitration are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to these claims, individually or in the aggregate, could have a\nmaterial impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and\narbitration of these matters can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the\naggregate, diversion of management resources and other factors.\nState Unemployment Taxes\nNew Jersey Department of Labor\nIn 2018, the New Jersey Department of Labor (“NJDOL”) opened an audit reviewing whether Drivers were independent\ncontractors or employees for purposes of determining whether unemployment insurance regulations apply from 2014 through 2018.\nThe NJDOL made an assessment on November 12, 2019, against both Rasier and Uber. Both assessments were calculated through\nNovember 15, 2019, but only calculated the alleged contributions, penalties, and interests owed from 2014 through 2018. The NJDOL\nhas provided several assessments from February through October 2021. We have submitted payment for the principal revised amount\nof the assessment and have since reached agreement on and paid the remaining amounts allegedly owed from 2014 through 2018.\nThe NJ DOL has initiated an audit for the period of 2019 through the second quarter of 2023. The ultimate resolution of the\nmatter is uncertain and the amount accrued for those matters is recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024.\nCalifornia Employment Development Department\nIn 2014, the California employment development department (“CA EDD”) opened an audit to review whether drivers should be\ntreated as employees or independent contractors. The department issued an assessment in 2016 for the periods of 2013 - 2015 and we\nhave since reached an agreement with the CA EDD for this period. In 2022, we received requests for information related to an audit of\na subsequent period, which covers the fourth quarter of 2017 through the fourth quarter of 2020. We have also received an audit for\nthe years 2018 - 2020 covering couriers who used the Postmates platform and received an assessment in June 2023. We are in the\nprocess of appealing the assessment. The ultimate resolution of the matter is uncertain and the amount accrued for those matters is\nrecorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024.\nOther Matters\n122",
          "IPO Securities Litigation\nBeginning in September 2019, putative class actions were filed in California state and federal courts against us, our directors,\ncertain of our officers, and the underwriters named in our IPO registration statement, alleging violations of securities laws in\nconnection with our May 2019 IPO. Following dismissal of certain matters, the remaining actions were consolidated in the Northern\nDistrict of California, which granted Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in July 2022. On April 24, 2024, the parties informed the\ncourt that they were negotiating a settlement agreement, and the court stayed the litigation. On July 19, 2024, the parties executed and\npublicly filed a settlement agreement. On August 9, 2024, the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement. On December 4,\n2024, the court granted final approval and the matter was resolved. The settlement has been fully paid. Separately, a shareholder filed\na follow-on derivative action on behalf of the Company, against the same officers and directors, and that matter has been stayed since\nFebruary 2021, with a status conference scheduled for March 13, 2025.\nNon-Income Tax Matters\nWe recorded an estimated liability for contingencies related to non-income tax matters and are under audit by various domestic\nand foreign tax authorities with regard to such matters.\nThe subject matter of these contingent liabilities and non-income tax audits primarily arise from the characterization for tax\npurposes of the transactions on the platform, as well as the application of certain employee benefits and employment and income taxes\nto our Drivers and Couriers. In jurisdictions with disputes connected to transactions on the platform, disputes involve the applicability\nof transactional taxes (such as sales tax, VAT, GST and similar taxes) or gross receipts taxes. In jurisdictions with disputes connected\nto employment or income taxes, disputes involve the applicability of withholding taxes related to employment taxes or back-up\nincome tax withholding on payments made to Drivers, Couriers, and Merchants.\nOur estimated liability is inherently subjective due to the complexity and uncertainty of these matters and the judicial processes in\ncertain jurisdictions; therefore, the final outcome could be materially different from the estimated liability recorded.\nUnited Kingdom\nAs of March 14, 2022, we modified our operating model in the UK, such that as of that date Uber UK is a merchant of\ntransportation and is required to remit VAT. Uber UK is remitting VAT under the Value Added (Tour Operators) Order 1987 (“VAT\nOrder 1987”), which allows for VAT remittance on a calculated margin, rather than on Gross Bookings.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we have received multiple assessments from the HMRC disputing our application of VAT Order 1987\nfor the period of March 2022 to June 2024, totaling approximately $1.6 billion (£1.3 billion) for unpaid VAT. Uber paid the\nassessments in order to proceed with the appeal process. The payments do not represent our acceptance of the assessments.\nThe payments made in 2023 and 2024 are recorded as a receivable in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet because we\nbelieve that we will be successful in our appeal, upon which, the full amount of our payments will be returned to us with interest upon\ncompletion of the appeals process. We expect to receive additional assessments related to this matter and will be required to pay the\nassessments in order to continue with the appeals process. Any payments are expected to decrease operating cash flow and have no\nimpact on our results of operations. We plan to vigorously defend our application of the VAT Order 1987 and are waiting to obtain\nhearing dates from the Tax Tribunal.\nBrazil\nIn May 2023, we received an assessment for 2019 and 2020 Driver social security contributions from the Brazilian Federal\nRevenue Bureau (“FRB”). We are contesting the assessment and we filed our administrative appeal with the FRB in June 2023. In\nApril 2024, we received a positive decision from the FRB. This decision was appealed, and another positive decision to Uber was\nissued by the Court of Appeals in September 2024, maintaining the first instance decision. If the tax authorities in Brazil appeal this\nsecond positive decision, Uber will continue to defend its position.\nIn December 2024, due to the absence of an appeal from the National Treasury, a formal document was issued confirming the\nclosure of the case in the Company’s favor. As a result, the case has been archived and closed.\n123",
          "Other Legal and Regulatory Matters\nWe have been or are currently subject to various government inquiries and investigations surrounding the legality of certain of our\nbusiness practices, compliance with antitrust, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws (including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act) and\nother global regulatory requirements, labor laws, securities laws, data protection and privacy laws, consumer protection laws,\nenvironmental laws, and the infringement of certain intellectual property rights. We are investigating many of these matters and are\nimplementing a number of recommendations to our managerial, operational and compliance practices, as well as strengthening our\noverall governance structure. In many cases, we are unable to predict the outcomes and implications of these inquiries and\ninvestigations on our business which could be time consuming, costly to investigate and require significant management attention.\nFurthermore, the outcome of these inquiries and investigations could negatively impact our business, reputation, financial condition\nand operating results, including possible fines and penalties and requiring changes to operational activities and procedures.\nWe have been and expect to continue to be subject to personal injury claims for compensation based on traffic accidents, deaths,\ninjuries, or other incidents that are caused by Drivers, consumers, or third parties while using our platform, or even when Drivers,\nconsumers, or third parties are not actively using our platform. Various plaintiffs have also coordinated and may in the future attempt\nto coordinate individual injury claims in various jurisdictions. We use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance\nmechanisms to provide for personal injury risks. Our insurance reserves include unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses related to\nthese claims.\nIndemnifications\nIn the ordinary course of business, we often include standard indemnification provisions in our arrangements with third parties.\nPursuant to these provisions, we may be obligated to indemnify such parties for losses or claims suffered or incurred in connection\nwith their activities or non-compliance with certain representations and warranties made by us. In addition, we have entered into\nindemnification agreements with our officers, directors, and certain current and former employees, and our certificate of incorporation\nand bylaws contain certain indemnification obligations. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these\nindemnification provisions / obligations because of the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular situation.\nNote 15 – Variable Interest Entities\nConsolidated VIEs\nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary because\nwe have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these VIEs. As a result, we\nconsolidate the assets and liabilities of these consolidated VIEs.\nTotal assets included on the consolidated balance sheets for our consolidated VIEs as of December 31, 2023 and 2024 were $3.5\nbillion and $3.4 billion, respectively. Total liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheets for these VIEs as of December 31,\n2023 and 2024 were $755 million and $724 million, respectively.\nUber Freight Holding Corporation\nIn July 2018, we created a new majority-owned subsidiary, Uber Freight Holding Corporation (“Freight Holding”). The purpose\nof Freight Holding is to perform the business activities of the Freight operating segment. The Freight Holding stock held by us was\ndetermined to be a variable interest.\nIn October 2020, Freight Holding entered into a Series A preferred stock purchase agreement (“2020 Freight Series A Preferred\nStock Purchase Agreement”) with an outside investor (“2020 Freight Series A Investor”) to sell shares of Series A Preferred Stock\n(“Freight Series A”).\nIn July 2021, we entered into a Freight Series A preferred stock purchase agreement and sold shares of Freight Series A to The\nPublic Investment Fund, which is an investor in Uber.\nIn November 2021, Freight Holding entered into a series A-1 stock purchase agreement (“2021 Series A-1 Preferred Stock\nPurchase Agreement”) with outside investors (“Freight Series A-1 Investors”) to sell shares of Series A-1 convertible preferred stock\nof Freight Holding (“Freight Series A-1”). Neither the Freight Series A nor Freight Series A-1 investments changed the conclusion that\nFreight Holding is a consolidated VIE. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, we continue to own the majority of the issued and\noutstanding capital stock of Freight Holding and report a non-controlling interest as further described in Note 16 – Non-Controlling\nInterests.\nIn February 2023, Freight Holding entered into a $300 million senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility guaranteed by\nthe assets of Freight Holding. As of December 31, 2023, there was no balance outstanding on Freight Holding’s revolving credit\nfacility. In November 2024, Freight Holding terminated the revolving credit facility.\n124",
          "Unconsolidated VIEs\nWe do not consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest but are not the primary beneficiary because we lack the power to\ndirect the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance. We are exposed to these unconsolidated VIEs’\neconomic risks and rewards through the related carrying amount of assets and liabilities and any financial guarantees, which represent\nvariable interests. Our carrying amounts of both assets and liabilities recognized on the consolidated balance sheets related to\nunconsolidated VIEs noted below were $575 million and $577 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. As of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2024, our maximum exposure to loss was $686 million and $691 million, respectively. Our maximum\nexposure to loss includes the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities recognized on our consolidated balance sheet related to the\nunconsolidated VIEs noted below as well as an immaterial financial guarantee.\nLime\nLime is incorporated in Delaware for the purpose of owning and operating a fleet of dockless e-bikes and e-scooters for short-\nterm access use by consumers for personal transportation. Our ownership in Lime is comprised of Lime Common Stock, Lime 1-C\nPreferred Stock, Lime 1-C Preferred Stock Warrants, and the Lime Convertible Note (collectively, the “2020 Lime Investments”). We\nare exposed to Lime’s economic risks and rewards through the related carrying amount of assets and liabilities and any financial\nguarantees, which represent variable interests.\nMoove\nOn February 12, 2021 (the “Moove Closing Date”), we entered into and completed a series of agreements with Garment\nInvestments S.L. dba Moove (“Moove”), a vehicle fleet operator in Spain, including (i) an equity investment, through preferred shares,\nin which Uber acquired a 30% minority interest in Moove from its current shareholders at closing and up to approximately $185\nmillion contingent on future performance of Moove and certain other conditions through the eighth anniversary of the agreement, (ii) a\nterm loan of $213 million to Moove, due February 2026, and (iii) a commercial partnership agreement. Also included in the\nagreements is an option for us to purchase common stock of Moove at fair value, beginning two years after the Moove Closing Date.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we have not exercised this option. After this series of agreements, Moove is considered a related party.\nIn February 2023, we entered into a settlement and amendment agreement (“Moove Settlement”) with Moove, a related party, to\nsettle certain contingent considerations agreements. As a result of the Moove Settlement, we made an immaterial payment to Moove.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the remaining contingent liability was recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on our\nconsolidated balance sheet and was not material. The contingent liability was paid in January 2024.\nOur equity investment in Moove, through preferred shares, is accounted for as an investment in non-marketable equity securities\nincluded in investments on our consolidated balance sheets. The term loan, of $288 million as of December 31, 2024, is accounted for\nas a loan receivable, carried at amortized cost, and included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 3 –\nInvestments and Fair Value Measurement, Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis, for additional information\nregarding our non-marketable equity securities.\nNote 16 – Non-Controlling Interests\nWe have consolidated subsidiaries that have issued common stock and preferred stock or preferred units to third party investors,\nrepresenting non-controlling interests. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the carrying value of non-controlling interests represented\nby subsidiaries’ preferred units and preferred stock were $1.6 billion and $820 million, respectively.\nFreight Holding\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2024, we owned 74% and 84%, respectively, of our subsidiary Freight Holding capital stock, or\n72% and 80%, respectively, on a fully-diluted basis. The minority stockholders of Freight Holding include, among others: (i) holders\nof Freight Holding’s Series A and A-1 Preferred Stock; (ii) holders of common equity awards issued under the employee equity\nincentive plans; and (iii) current and former employees who hold fully vested shares.\nAs of December 31, 2023, a total number of 356.7 million shares of Freight Holding were reserved, of which 273.8 million shares\nwere available for grant and issuance.\nAs of December 31, 2024, a total number of 356.7 million shares of Freight Holding were reserved, of which 225.4 million shares\nwere available for grant and issuance.\n125",
          "Certain Holders of Common Stock of Freight Holding\nCertain minority common stockholders of our subsidiary Freight Holding, including individuals who hold shares obtained from\nthe exercise of vested stock options issued under Freight Holding’s 2018 employee equity incentive plan, have put rights to sell\nincreasing percentages of their equity interests at fair value to Freight Holding at specified periods of time ending in August 2025\nthrough August 2027 that terminates upon the earliest of the closing of a liquidation transaction or an IPO of the subsidiary; provided,\nhowever, that former employees who hold shares will only have a one-time opportunity to exercise their put right to sell 100% of their\nequity interests for a specified period of time ending in August 2025. Should the put rights be exercised, they can be satisfied in either\ncash, Uber stock, or a combination of cash and Uber stock based upon our election.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the minority common stockholders ownership in Freight Holding is classified as a\nredeemable non-controlling interest, because it is redeemable on an event that is not solely in our control. In the third quarter of 2024,\nthe redeemable non-controlling interest related to these certain minority common stockholders of Freight Holding was deemed\nprobable of becoming redeemable and re-measured to its estimated redemption value with an adjustment of $338 million. This\nredeemable non-controlling interest is re-measured to its estimated redemption value each reporting period.\nWe attribute the pro rata share of Freight Holding’s net income or loss available to holders of common stock to the redeemable\nnon-controlling interests generated from common shares of Freight Holding based on the outstanding ownership of the minority\nshareholders of common shares during the period.\nFreight Series A Preferred Stock\nIn October 2020, Freight Holding entered into a 2020 Freight Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with a 2020 Freight\nSeries A Investor. Pursuant to the 2020 Freight Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, the 2020 Freight Series A Investor\nagreed to invest an aggregate of $500 million in Freight Holding, which occurred over two closings, subject to customary closing\nconditions.\nIn October 2020, the initial closing occurred pursuant to the 2020 Freight Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement and 2020\nFreight Series A Investor invested $250 million in exchange for 124.7 million shares of Freight Series A preferred stock.\nIn August 2022, the second closing occurred pursuant to the Freight Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement and the 2020\nFreight Series A Investor invested an additional $250 million in exchange for 124.7 million shares of Freight Series A preferred stock.\nPrior to their redemption in October 2024, the 2020 Freight Series A Investor was considered a related party to Freight Holding.\nWe do not attribute the pro rata share of the Freight Holding’s loss to the redeemable non-controlling interests in Series A\nPreferred shares of Freight Holding because these shares are entitled to a liquidation preference and therefore do not participate in\nlosses that would cause their interest to be below the liquidation preference. Upon liquidation, these Freight Series A preferred stock\nare entitled to the greater of either (i) a 1.5x liquidation preference on their initial investment, as well as 6% continuously\ncompounding cumulative dividends that will be paid before any distribution to common shareholders or (ii) the fair value of their\ninvestment (the “Freight Series A Liquidation Preference”). The dividend, along with any attributed prorated share of Freight\nHolding’s net income (if applicable), are included in net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax in our\nconsolidated statements of operations.\nOn October 6, 2023, the 2020 Freight Series A Investor exercised their right to require that either Freight Holding conduct an IPO\nor we redeem them at the Freight Series A Liquidation Preference, described above.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Freight Series A preferred stock held by the 2020 Freight Series A Investor is classified as a\nredeemable non-controlling interest, because it is redeemable on an event that is not solely in our control. Given the 2020 Freight\nSeries A Investor exercised their right during the fourth quarter of 2023, this redeemable non-controlling interest was deemed probable\nof redemption. Based on the Freight Series A Liquidation Preference, this redeemable non-controlling interest was re-measured to its\nfull estimated redemption value with an adjustment of $286 million. Upon the redemption date in October 2024, we repurchased the\n2020 Freight Series A Investor’s Freight Series A preferred stock in cash for $851 million.\nIn July 2021, we entered into a Series A preferred stock purchase agreement and sold shares of Freight Holding's Series A\nPreferred Stock to The Public Investment Fund, which is an investor in Uber, representing 4% ownership interest on a fully diluted\nbasis at the time of the sale. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the Freight Series A preferred stock held by the Public Investment\nFund were classified as non-redeemable non-controlling interests as these shares of preferred stock are not subject to any mandatory\nredemption rights or redemption rights that are outside our control.\nFreight Series A-1 Preferred Stock\nIn November 2021, Freight Holding entered into a 2021 Series A-1 Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with Freight Series A-1\nInvestors. Pursuant to the 2021 Series A-1 Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, the Freight Series A-1 Investors agreed to invest an\naggregate of $550 million in Freight Holding in exchange for Freight Series A-1 preferred stock.\nFreight Series A-1 Investors have basic rights and preferences which primarily include: one vote per share; conversion rights to\ncommon shares; 6% cumulative dividend preference and liquidation preference (a 1.0x liquidation preference of original issuance\n126",
          "price plus cumulative unpaid dividends). The accruing dividends are compounding annually, and are only payable when dividends are\ndeclared by Freight Holding’s Board. The dividend, along with any attributed prorated share of Freight Holding’s net income (if\napplicable), are included in net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax in our consolidated statements of\noperations. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the Freight Series A-1 preferred stock held by the Freight Series A-1 Investors were\nclassified as non-redeemable non-controlling interests as these shares of preferred stock are not subject to any mandatory redemption\nrights or redemption rights that are outside our control.\nFreight Holding Supplier Financing Program\nFreight Holding utilizes a third-party financial institution that allows our suppliers to be paid by the third-party financial\ninstitution earlier than the due date on the applicable invoice at a discounted price. In general, supplier invoices financed by the third-\nparty financial institution are due for payment by Freight Holding within thirty days.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the liability related to Freight Holding’s supplier financing program are included within\naccounts payable on the consolidated balance sheets. A rollforward of Freight Holding obligations confirmed and paid during the year\nis presented below (in millions):\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2024\nConfirmed obligations outstanding balance at the beginning of the year $ 125\nInvoices confirmed during the year 1,838\nConfirmed invoices paid during the year (1,863)\nConfirmed obligations outstanding at the end of the year $ 100\nNote 17 – Divestitures\nDivestiture of Careem Technologies\nIn December 2023, we divested Careem’s non-ridesharing business and completed the agreement with e& whereby e&\ncontributed $400 million to Careem Technologies in exchange for a majority equity interest. Refer to Note 4 - Equity Method\nInvestments for further information.\nThe following table presents the gain on sale of the interest in Careem Technologies.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL\nDISCLOSURE\nNone.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be\ndisclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms\nand that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the\nExchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon that\nevaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024\nthat have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and\nprocedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and\nare effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures\nor our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well\n128",
          "designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives\nwill be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or\nthat all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in\nRule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over\nfinancial reporting based on the criteria established in “Internal Control - Integrated Framework” (2013) issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on that assessment, our management has concluded that\nour internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. In addition, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our\nindependent registered public accounting firm, provided an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2024.
