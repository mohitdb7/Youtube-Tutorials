    "### 1. Tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "The text is first broken down into smaller units called **tokens** (words, sub-words, or characters) by a **tokenizer**. Each token is then assigned a unique **numerical ID** from the model's vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "These numerical IDs are passed to an **embedding model**, which generates a **vector** of floating-point numbers for each token. This vector is the **embedding**, and it captures the **semantic meaning** of the token. Tokens with similar meanings are positioned closer together in the high-dimensional embedding space.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Factual Corrections and Key Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Model Specificity:** Every model's embedding is unique, defined by its specific **training data and architecture**. Therefore, two different models will generate different embeddings for the exact same token.\n",
    "* **Dimensionality:** The **dimension** (length) of the embedding vector is a fixed architectural parameter. It determines the **capacity** for the vector to store semantic information, but the specific **semantic information** is encoded by the values within the vector, which are learned during training.\n",
    "* **Types:** Embeddings are a general concept used across different data types, including **text**, **image/video**, and **audio**. \n",

          " \n4 \nPART I \nITEM 1. BUSINESS \nOverview \nUber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a technology platform that uses a massive network, \nleading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. We develop and operate \nproprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform (“ platform(s)” or “Platform(s)”). We conn ect \nconsumers (“Rider(s)”) with independent providers of ride services (“Mobility Driver(s)”) for ridesharing services, and connect Riders \nand other consumers (“Eater(s)”) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, “Merchants”) with delivery service providers \n(“Couriers”) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as “end- user(s)” \nor “consumer(s).” Mobility Dr ivers and Couriers are co llectively referred to as “Driver(s).” We also connect consumers with pub lic \ntransportation networks. We use this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers  \n(“Shipper(s)”) with carriers (“Carrier(s)”) in the freight industry by pr oviding Carriers with the ability to book a shipment, \ntransportation management and ot her logistics services. Uber is also developi ng technologies designed to  provide new solutions to \nsolve everyday problems. \nOur technology is available in over 70 countries around the world, principally in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada, Latin \nAmerica, Europe (excluding Russia), the Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific (“APAC”, excluding China and Southeast Asia). \nOur Segments \nAs of December 31, 2024, we had three operating and reportab le segments: Mobility, Delivery and Freight. Mobility, Delivery \nand Freight platform offerings each address large, fragmented markets.\n \nMobility \nOur Mobility offering connects consumers with  a wide range of transpor tation modalities, such as ridesharing, carsharing, \nmicromobility, rentals, public transit, taxis, and more—helping cu stomers go almost anywhere they need. We believe our global \nleadership position—and the vast amount of marketplace data that  comes along with it—means that we have the best technical and \ndata platform to innovate faster than other companies with similar products.  \nWe believe our scale and global availability allows our Mobility segment to offer better consumer experiences to riders in a \nvariety of vehicle types,  providing consumers with higher re liability and Drivers with better earnings opportunities. Mobility also \nincludes activity related to our financial partnerships products and advertising. \nDelivery \nOur Delivery offering allows consumers to search for and discove r the best of local commerce—from restaurants to grocery, \nalcohol, convenience and other retailers—order a meal or other item s, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have it delivered . We \nrefer to the grocery, alcohol, convenience, and retail categorie s collectively as Grocery & Retail. After launching our Deliver y app, \nUber Eats, over nine years ago, we believe our Delivery offering increases consumer engagement with the Uber platform overall, \nwhich in turn results in broader reach fo r our Merchants who can attract Uber Eats consumers from Uber without increasing their  own \ncosts. For Drivers, we believe the Delivery offering leverages,  and has expanded, our earner base by increasing utilization and  \nearnings across the network. We also believe it attracts new Driv ers to the platform who do no t have access to Mobility-qualifi ed \nvehicles. Over the last several years, our Delivery business has expanded to include Uber Direct, our white-label Delivery-as-a -\nService offering to retailers and restaurants around the world, as well as advertising opportunities.\n \nFreight \nWe believe that Freight is revolutionizi ng the logistics industry. Freight powers a managed transportation and logistics networ k \nand connects Shippers and Carriers in a digital marketplace to move shipments while leveraging our proprietary technology, bran d \nawareness, and experience revolutionizing i ndustries. Freight provides an on-demand plat form to automate and accelerate logisti cs \ntransactions end-to-end while pr oviding visibility and control of  logistics networks. Freight connects Carriers with Shippers’ \nshipments available on our platform, and give s Carriers upfront, transparent pricing a nd the ability to book a shipment with the touch \nof a button. Freight serves Shippers rangi ng from small- and medium-sized businesses to  global enterprises. By leveraging logis tics \nsolutions expertise and value-add solutions, Freight enables Shippers to create and tender shipments, secure capacity on demand  with \nreal-time pricing, and track those shipments from pickup to deliv ery. Freight operations are principally based in North America  and \nEurope. We believe that all of these factors represent signifi cant efficiency improvements ove r traditional transportation mana gement \nand freight brokerage providers. ",
          " \n5 \nPlatform Synergies \nOur Platform \nThe foundation of our platform is our massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise. \nTogether, these elements power movement from point A to point B. \nMassive Network\n \n \nOur massive, efficient, and intell igent network consists of tens of  millions of Drivers, consumers, \nMerchants, Shippers and Carriers, as well as unde rlying data, technology, and shared infrastructure. \nOur network becomes smarter with  every trip. In more than 15, 000 cities around the world (as of \nDecember 31, 2024), our network powers movement at  the touch of a button for millions, and we hope \neventually billions, of people. \nLeading Technology \n \nWe have built proprietary marketpl ace, routing, and payments tec hnologies. Marketplace technologies \nare the core of our deep technology advantag e and include demand prediction, matching and \ndispatching, and pricing technol ogies. Our technologies make it extremely efficient to launch new \nbusinesses and operationalize existing ones. \nOperational Excellence \n \nOur regional on-the-ground operations teams use thei r extensive market-specific knowledge to rapidly \nlaunch and scale products in cities, support Drivers, consumers, Merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, and \nbuild and enhance relationships with cities and regulators. \nProduct Expertise \n \nOur products are built with the expertise that allows  us to set the standard for powering movement on-\ndemand, provide platform users with a contextual, in tuitive interface, continua lly evolve features and \nfunctionality, and deliver safety and trust. \nWe intend to continue to invest in new platform offerings th at we believe will further stre ngthen our platform and existing \nofferings. \nWe believe that all of these synergies serve the customer experience, enabling us to attract new platform users and to deepen \nengagement with existing platform users. Both of these dynamics grow our network sc ale and liquidity, which further increases t he \nvalue of our platform-to-platform users. For example, Delivery attracts new consumers to our network—for the three months ended  \nDecember 31, 2024, approximately 61% of first-time Delivery consumers were new to our platform. Additionally, for the three months \nended December 31, 2024, consumers who used both Mobility and Delivery generated 11.4 Trips per month on average, compared to \n5.2 Trips per month on average for consumers who used a single of fering in cities where both Mobility and Delivery were offered . We \nbelieve that these trends will improve as we further leverage the power of our platform. \nMembership \nWith our platform, we are making it even easier for our consumers to unlock convenience—Uber One is our single cross-platform \nmembership program that brings together the best of Uber. Uber  One members have access to disc ounts, special pricing, priority \nservice, and exclusive perks across our rides, delivery and grocery and retail offerings. Uber One is available in over 30 countries. Our \nEats Pass membership program continues to remain available in se lect cities as a subscription offering. Our membership programs  are \ndesigned to make utilizing our suite of products a seamless and rewarding experience for our consumers. As of December 31, 2024 , \nUber One member base reached 30 million.  \nAdvertising \nWe are also utilizing our data and scale to offer marketplace- centric advertising to connect merchants and brands with our \nplatform network and unlocking cross-platform  advertising formats. During October 2022, we officially launched Uber’s advertisi ng \ndivision and introduced Uber Journey Ads, an  engaging way for brands to connect with consumers throughout the entire ride proce ss. \nWe now offer a model that enables brands to partner with Uber on a variety of advertising options on the Uber and Uber Eats app s, \nand beyond, while connecting with consumers in brand-safe and captivating ways. We also provi de comprehensive reporting and \nanalysis, which helps brands fine-tune their understanding of cons umers and create more impactful campaigns as they connect wit h \nconsumers at relevant points throughout thei r journeys and transactions. We believe that our advertising further strengthens th e power \nof our platform and will continue to do so as we onboard more advertisers. \nCompetitive Environment \nWe compete on a global basis in highly fragmented markets. We face  significant competition in each  of the mobility and delivery  \nindustries globally and in the logistics i ndustry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost  \nalternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers to entry that cha racterize \nthese industries. As we and our competito rs introduce new products and offerings, and as ex isting products  evolve, we expect to  \nbecome subject to additional competition. While we work to expand globally a nd introduce new products and offerings across a range \nof industries, many of  our competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing \nthem to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do. The competition we face in eac h of \nour offerings includes: ",
          " \n6 \n• Mobility. Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle owne rship and usage, which acc ounts for the majority of \npassenger miles in the markets that we se rve, and traditional transportation servic es, including taxicab companies and taxi-\nhailing services, livery and other car services. In addition, public  transportation can be a superi or substitute to our Mobilit y \noffering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in many cities. We also compete with other \nridesharing companies for Drivers and Riders, including Bolt, Didi, Grab, Lyft, and Ola. \n• Delivery. Our Delivery offering competes with numerous companies in  the meal, grocery and other delivery space in various \nregions for drivers, consumers, and merchants, including DoorDash, Deliveroo, Glovo, Instacart, Gopuff, Rappi, iFood, \nDelivery Hero, Just Eat Takeaway, and Amazon. Our Delivery offe ring also competes with rest aurants and other merchants, \nincluding those that offer their own delivery and/or take-away,  meal kit delivery services, grocery delivery services, and \ntraditional grocers. \n• Freight. Our Freight offering competes with global and North American freight brokers and managed transportation providers \nsuch as C.H. Robinson, Total Quality Logistics, RXO, XPO, Echo Global Logistics, DHL, and NEXT Trucking. \nGovernment Regulation \nWe operate in a particularly complex legal and regulatory environm ent. Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. federal, st ate, \nlocal and foreign laws, rules, and regulations, including those re lated to Internet activities, privacy, cybersecurity, data pr otection, \nintellectual property, competition, consum er protection, payments, labor and employm ent, transportation services, transportatio n \nnetwork companies, licensing regulations and taxation. These laws  and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interprete d, \napplied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business. Examples of certain laws and regulations we are subject to are \ndescribed below. For further discussion of risks relating to gove rnment regulation, see our risk factors, including the risk factors in the \nsection titled “Legal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nOur platform, and in particular our Mobilit y products, are subject to di ffering, and sometimes conf licting, laws, rules, and \nregulations in the numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. A large number of proposals are be fore various national, regiona l, and \nlocal legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to \nour business model. \nIn the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restric tions and other requirements on \noperating our Mobility products, including licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements. Outside of the United \nStates, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules, and regulations while other jurisdictions have not adopted any laws, \nrules, and regulations which govern our Mobility business. Furt her, certain jurisdictions, incl uding Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, \nSouth Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, and regulations b anning \ncertain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational rest rictions. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environ ment \ncreates significant complexities for our business and operating m odel. In addition, our Delivery and Freight products are also subject \nto laws, regulations and standards that govern the transportation of food, alcohol and other goods. \nSubstantially all states in the United States and numerous muni cipalities in the United States and around the world have adopte d \nTransportation Network Company (“TNC”) regul ations. These regulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or \nmobile apps that connect individual drivers with their own vehi cles to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their \ndestinations. These regulations often require TNCs to comply w ith rules regarding, among other things, background checks, vehic le \ninspections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters. \nIn addition, many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that a pply to how we classify the Drivers who use our platform. This \nuncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates signifi cant complexities for our business and operating model. As we \ncontinue to expand our offerings, we may be subject to additi onal regulations separate from those that apply to our existing pr oducts. \nSee the section titled “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A and “Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated \nfinancial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nData Privacy and Protection \nOur technology platform, and the user data we collect and process to run our business, are an inte gral part of our business mod el \nand, as a result, our compliance with laws dealing with the co llection and processing of personal data is core to our strategy to \nimprove platform user experience and build  trust. Regulators around the world have ad opted or proposed requirements regarding t he \ncollection, use, transfer, security, storage, destruction, and other processing of personal data, and these laws are increasing  in number, \nenforcement, fines, and other penalties. Two examples of such re gulations that have significant implications for our business a re the \nEuropean Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), a law which went into effect in May 2018 and implemented \nmore stringent requirements for processing personal data relating to individuals in the EU, and the California Consumer Privacy  Act \n(the “CCPA”), which went into effect in January 2020 and es tablished new consumer rights a nd data privacy and protection \nrequirements for covered businesses. U.S. state, city, federal, and foreign regulators are expected to continue proposing and a dopting \nsignificant laws impacting the processing of personal data and ot her data relating to individuals, such as the California Priva cy Rights \nAct (“CPRA”) passed in California (effective in January 2023), and India’s Digital Personal Data Protection Act enacted in 2023. ",
          " \n7 \nPayments and Financial Services \nMost jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that gove rn payment and financial services activities. For example, our \nsubsidiary in the Netherlands, Uber Payments B.V ., is registered and authorized as an electronic money institution in support of certain \npayment activities in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) . We hold similar licenses in the United Kingdom and Mexico. \nRegulators in certain additional jurisdictions  may determine that certain aspects of our  business are subject to these laws and  could \nrequire us to obtain licenses to continue to operate in such jurisdictions. In addition, laws related to money transmission and  online \npayments are evolving, and changes in such laws could affect our  ability to provide payment processing on our platform or to of fer or \npromote certain financial services to users of the platform. We  are continuing to evaluate our options for seeking further lice nses and \napprovals in several other jurisdictions to optimize payment solutions and support future growth of our business. \nAntitrust \nCompetition authorities closely sc rutinize us under U.S. and fo reign antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of \ngovernments are enforcing competition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as \nthe EU, the United States, Brazil, and India,  particularly surrounding issues of pricing parity, price-fixing, and abuse of market power. \nIn addition, governmental agencies and regulators may, among ot her things, prohibit future acquisitions, divestitures, or combi nations \nwe plan to make, impose significant fines or penalties, require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other restrictions that limit \nor require us to modify our operations, including limitations on our contractual relati onships with platform users or restrictions on our \npricing models. \nIntellectual Property \nWe believe that our intellectual property is essential to our business and affords us a compe titive advantage in the markets in  \nwhich we operate. Our intellectual property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, social \nmedia accounts/handles, software code, firmware, hardware and ha rdware designs, registered and unregistered trademarks, tradema rk \napplications, copyrights, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable), patents, and patent applications. \nTo protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademar k, patent, and trade secret laws, contract ual \nprovisions, end-user policies, and disclosure  restrictions. Upon discovery of potentia l infringement of our intellectual proper ty, we \nassess and when necessary, take action to protect our rights as appropriate. We also enter into confidentiality agreements and invention \nassignment agreements with our employees and consultants and se ek to control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary \ninformation in a commercially prudent manner. \nResearch and Development \nBecause the industries in which we comp ete are characterized by ra pid technological a dvances, our ability to compete \nsuccessfully depends heavily upon our ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive new offerings and technologies. We \ncontinue to develop new technologies to en hance existing offerings and services, and to  expand the range of our offerings throu gh \nresearch and development (“R&D”) and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. \nSeasonality \nMobility \nWe typically expect to experience seasonal impacts to our operati ng results as we generate highe r Gross Bookings in our fourth \nquarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth-quarter holiday and busine ss demand, and typically generate lower Gros\ns \nBookings in our first quarter compared to other quarters due in pa rt to less usage of our platform as holiday demand slows down . We \nhave typically experienced softer quarter-over-quarter Mobility trends in the first quarter. \nDelivery \nWe typically expect to experience seasonal impacts to our operati ng results with increases in our  Gross Bookings in the fourth \nquarter compared to other quarters. \nHuman Capital at Uber \nEmployees \nWe are a global company and as of December 31, 2024, we a nd our subsidiaries had approximately 31, 100 employees globally \nand operations in over 70 countries and more than 15,000 cities around the world. Our human capital strategies are developed an d \nmanaged by our Chief People Officer, who re ports to the CEO, and are overseen by th e Compensation Committee and the Board of \nDirectors. \nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other \npersonnel who are in high demand, are often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for o ur \ncompetitors. ",
          " \n8 \nEmployee Engagement. To attract and retain the best talent, we strive to establish a culture where people are able to achieve their \nhighest capability. We measure how successful we have been in  establishing the culture we need through employee engagement \nsurveys and related tools. We conduct continuous listening by colle cting feedback from employees throughout the year and throug h \nvarious channels. We use the results of these regular checks to better understand employees’ needs and support their teams on t opics \nsuch as well-being, fairness, re wards and recognition, and growth  opportunities. For example, our  hybrid work approach was shap ed \nbased on employee feedback. In addition to the engagement survey results, we also monitor the health of our workforce and the \nsuccess of our people operations through monitoring metrics such as attrition, retention, and offer acceptance rates. \nEmployee Development and Retention . We believe that employees who have opportunities for development are more engaged, \nsatisfied, and productive. Employees are empowered to drive th eir own growth, whether by lear ning on the job, finding stretch \nassignments, participating in mentorship, or identifying their next opportunity within Uber th rough internal mobility programs.  \nEmployees have access to an internal jobs marketplace for full-time jobs as well as short-term stretch assignments that enable them to \nhave an impact on other areas of the business. Our goal is to he lp our employees be their best selves by providing programs and  \nresources that promote wellness and productiv ity. Globally, Uber offers competitive bene fits packages to our  employees and thei r \nfamilies.  \nFor additional discussion, see the risk factor titled “—Our business depends on retaining a nd attracting high- quality personnel, \nand continued attrition, future attrition,  or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business.” included i n Part I, \nItem 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nDriver and Courier Well-Being \nIn addition to employees discussed above, our business also depe nds on our ability to attract and engage Drivers, consumers, \nMerchants, Shippers, and Couriers, as well as contractors and consultants that support our global operations. \nIn relation to those individuals who earn in come on our platform, Uber is one of the largest open platforms for work in the world, \nproviding accessible, flexible work in over 70 countries. Drivers are key parts of the ma rketplaces that Uber  has created throu gh its \napps. People choose to use our platform to earn income without ha ving to apply for, or work the fixed schedules associated with , \ntraditional employment. We believe this flexibility is an improvement over traditional work schedules and is something we believe can \nand should remain available to anyone who chooses platform-bas ed work. Uber monitors regional and global driver attraction, \nretention and satisfaction rates. \nAccessible, flexible, independent work has offered an option fo r many workers historically marg inalized from the labor market \nand has enabled wide geographic coverage and reliable service of ferings for consumers. However, it is increasingly clear that m ore \ncan be done to improve the experi ence of using an app to connect with work opportunities. Although the situation varies across \ncountries and cities, the benefits and protections for independent  workers are generally patchy compared with those that employ ees \nreceive. The current binary system of employment classification under some legal frameworks means that a worker is either an \nemployee who is provided significant social benefits or an independe nt worker who has access to relatively few. This does not h ave to \nbe the case. At Uber, we believe that being your own boss should not  have to come at the expense of security and dignity in wor k. \nAround the world, Uber has found innovative ways to address these issues. \n• Advocacy: We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent \nworkers. We believe all work should be treated equally. We also  believe that legislative reform is needed to modernize the \nsocial safety net. This includes requiring Uber—and other app ba sed companies—to provide benefi ts and protections to their \nusers without compromising the flex ibility of their use of the app.  Some examples of our advocacy  to preserve flexibility of \nwork while expanding access to benefits and protections are as follows: \n◦ In Washington State, we partnered with industry and labor to support a bill regulati ng rideshare, including minimum \nearnings, sick leave, paid family and medical leave, and workers’ compensation coverage for drivers. \n◦ In New York and Massachusetts, we reached agreements wi th the Attorneys General that introduce new protections \nfor rideshare drivers in these states, including minimum earnings and various benefits. \n◦ In France, we reached a number of sectoral bargaining agreements with elected workers’ representatives to \nimplement new standards related to minimum guaranteed reve nues for couriers, minimum fare per trip for drivers, \nand deactivation transparency and appeals process for both. \n• Protections and benefits : We partner with leading insurance companie s around the world to pioneer protections for \nindependent workers.  \n• Earnings: We are continually developing new technology that Driver s can use to acquire information that may help them \nsave on costs and make informed choices about where and when to drive (based on when and where their earnings potential \nis highest).  \n• Learning and Growth : We have partnered with learning and academic institutions to provide opportunities to eligible \nDrivers and/or their family members through undergraduat e degree programs and courses on entrepreneurship, skills ",
          " \n9 \ndevelopment and language learning. For example, since its launc h in 2018, our partnership with Arizona State University has \nenrolled nearly 15,000 Drivers and their family members in English language learning and entrepreneurship courses. \n• Engagement: We are focused on listening to and responding to the ideas and concerns of Drivers and Merchants who use our \nplatform. We believe that the best ideas can come from anyw here, both inside and outside our company. In locations around \nthe world, we are piloting innovative ways for Drivers to partic ipate in meaningful dialogue w ith us. In markets across the \nworld, we hold regular meetings with Driver associations a nd conduct regular surveys to gather feedback on our app, our \nsupport services, and other matters.  \nFor additional discussion, see the risk factor titled “—If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, con sumers, \nmerchants, Shippers, and Carriers , whether as a result of competition or other fa ctors, our platform will become less appealing  to \nplatform users.” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nAdditional Information \nWe were founded in 2009 and incorporated as Ubercab, Inc., a Delaware corporation, in July 2010. In February 2011, we changed \nour name to Uber Technologies, Inc. Our principal executive offi ces are located at 1725 3rd Street, San Francisco, California 9 4158, \nand our telephone number is (415) 612-8582. \nOur website address is www.uber.com and our investor relations website is located at https://investor.uber.com.

RISK FACTORS \nCertain factors may have a material adver se effect on our business, financial cond ition, and results of operations. You should \ncarefully consider the following risks, togeth er with all of the other information cont ained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K , \nincluding the sections titled “Special Note Regarding Forward- Looking Statements” and “Management’ s Discussion and Analysis of \nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations” and our financ ial statements and the related notes  included elsewhere in this An nual \nReport on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could have an adverse effect on our business, fi nancial condition, operating results, \nor prospects and could cause the trading price of our common stock to  decline, which would cause you to lose all or part of you r \ninvestment. Our business, financia l condition, operating results, or prospects c ould also be harmed by  risks and uncertainties not \ncurrently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. \nRisk Factor Summary \nThe following are some of these risks, any of which could have  an adverse effect on our business financial condition, operating  \nresults, or prospects. \n• Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were clas sified as employees, workers or  quasi-employees instead of \nindependent contractors. \n• The mobility, delivery, and logist ics industries are highly competitive, with well -established and low-cost alternatives that \nhave been available for decades, low barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every \nmajor geographic region. \n• To remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and \nwe have in the past offered, and may continue to offer, significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions. \n• We have incurred significant losses, including in the Unit ed States and other major markets. We expect our operating \nexpenses to increase in the foreseeable future, and we may not maintain profitability. \n• If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Driv ers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, whether as a \nresult of competition or other factors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users. \n• Our business depends on retaini ng and attracting high-qu ality personnel, and c ontinued attrition, fu ture attrition, or \nunsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business. ",
          " \n10 \n• Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We receive significant media \ncoverage, including negative publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to \nrehabilitate our brand and reput ation, failure to maintain a nd enhance our brand and reputa tion will cause our business to \nsuffer. \n• We may fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our plat form, fail to offer such technologies on our platform before \nour competitors, or such technologies may fail to perform as expected, may be inferior to those offered by our competitors, or \nmay be perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-autonomous vehicles.  \n• If we are unable to optimize our organizational structure or ef fectively manage our growth, our financial performance and \nfuture prospects will be adversely affected. \n• Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges and \nour efforts to address these challenges may not be successful. \n• Platform users may engage in, or be subject to, criminal, viol ent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major \nsafety incidents, which may harm our ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers. \n• We are making substantial investments in new offerings and t echnologies, and may increase such investments in the future. \nThese new ventures are inherently risky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them. \n• We generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from  trips in large metropolitan areas, and these operations may \nbe negatively affected by economic, so cial, weather, and regulat ory conditions, public heal th concerns or other \ncircumstances.  \n• We have experienced and may experience security or priv acy breaches or other unauthor ized or improper access to, \nacquisition of, use of, disclosure of, altera tion of or destruction of our  proprietary or confidenti al data, employee data, or \nplatform user data. \n• Cyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses,  denial of service attacks, account takeovers, spamming, \nphishing, and social engineering attacks could harm our reputation, business, and operating results. \n• Our growing use of artificial intelligence and machine learni ng may present additional risks, including risks associated with \nalgorithm development or use, the tools and data sets used, and/or a complex, developing regulatory environment. \n• We are subject to climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, \nour business may be adversely impacted. \n• Increased attention to, and evolving expectations regarding sustainability matters may adversely impact our business, \nreputation and liabilities, including in the context of certain goals we have announced. \n• Occurrence of a catastrophic event, including but not limited to disease, a weather event, war, or terrorist attack, could \nadversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operation. \n• We rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to dist ribute our platform and to provide the software we use in \ncertain of our products and offerings. If such third parties interf ere with the distribution of our  products or offerings or wi th \nour use of such software, our business would be adversely affected. \n•\n We will require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this cap ital might not be available on reasonable  \nterms or at all. \n• If we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could  \nbe harmed, and any businesses we acquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated. \n• We may continue to be blocked from or limited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, \nand may be required to modify our business model in those jurisdictions as a result. \n• Our business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future \nprospects. \n• Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial \nservices. \n• We face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclo sure, and other processing of data, which have resulted and may \nresult in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legisl ative and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy  and \ndata protection practices. \n• If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if th ird parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriat ing \nthe intellectual property of others, we may incur significant expense and our business may be adversely affected. ",
          " \n11 \n• The market price of our common stock ha s been, and may continue to be, volatile or may decline steeply or suddenly \nregardless of our operating performance, and we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations. You may not be \nable to resell your shares at or above the price you paid and may lose all or part of your investment. \nOperational and Economic Risks Related to Our Business \nOperational Risks \nOur business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees. \nThe classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United \nStates and abroad. We are involved in nu merous legal proceedings gl obally, including putative class and collective class action  \nlawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before admi nistrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, so cial \nsecurity, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be  treated as our employees (or as  workers or quasi-employees where those \nstatuses exist), rather than as independe nt contractors. We believe that Drivers are independent contractors because, among oth er \nthings, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors’ \nplatforms, and provide a vehicle to perform services on our pl atform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the \nclassification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions. Furtherm ore, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolvin g pending \nand future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classification of Drivers have been and may continue to  be \nmaterial to our business. \nIn addition, more than 150,000 Drivers in the United States who ha ve entered into arbitration agre ements with us have filed (or  \nexpressed an intention to file) arbitration demands against us th at assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the \nclassification claims of a majority of these Drivers under individual settlement agreements. Furthermore, we are involved in numerous \nlegal proceedings regarding the enforceability of arbitration agre ements entered into with Drivers. If we are not successful in  such \nproceedings, this could negatively impact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an \nadverse consequence on our business and financial condition. \nChanges to foreign, state, and local laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial decisions \nregarding independent contractor classification, could require cl assification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-empl oyees \nwhere those statuses exist) and/or representation of Drivers by labor unions. For example, California’s Assembly Bill 5 became \neffective as of January 1, 2020. Governme nt authorities and private plaintiffs have brought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 \nrequires Drivers in California to be classified as employees. \nIn November 2020, California vot ers approved Proposition 22, a Ca lifornia state ballot  initiative that provi des a framework for  \ndrivers that use platforms like ours for inde pendent work. Proposition 22 we nt into effect in Decembe r 2020 and we expect that \nDrivers will be able to maintain their st atus as independent contract ors under California law and th at we and our competitors w ill be \nrequired to comply with the pr ovisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation to dissolv e the California Attorney General’\ns \npreliminary injunction was grante d in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, a nd we also may face li ability relating to p eriods \nbefore the effective date of  Proposition 22. The California Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality  of Proposition 22; howev er, \nlegal challenges, including constitutional challenges, to Proposition 22 may continue to be filed. \nWe face similar challenges in other jurisd ictions within the United States and abroad. For example, in July 2020, the \nMassachusetts Attorney General filed a comp laint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an  \ninjunction. That case was resolved in June 2024 with the understa nding that drivers would continue to be classified as independ ent \ncontractors. If we do not prevail in current litigation or simila r actions that may be brought in the future, we may be require d to treat \nDrivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If,  as a result of legislation o r judicial \ndecisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, we  would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, \nincluding expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage , overtime, and meal and rest \nperiod requirements), employee bene fits, social security contributions, taxes (dir ect and indirect), and potential penalties. I n this case, \nwe anticipate significant price increases fo r Riders to offset these additional costs; however, we believe that the financial i mpact to \nUber would be moderated by th e likelihood of other indus try participants being similarly affected. Add itionally, we may not hav e \nadequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we m ay \nnot be able to hire a majority of the Dr ivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us  to \nfundamentally change our business model, and consequently have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financ ial \nposition and cash flows. \nOther examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the Fr ench Supreme Court that a driver for a third-party meal delive ry \nservice was under a “subordinate relationship” of the service, indicating an employment relati onship, a decision by the French \nSupreme Court that reclassified an UberX Driver as an employ ee (which has been followed by inconsistent appellate decisions \nregarding employee status), decisions by several Swiss governmental  bodies ruling that Drivers shoul d be classified as employee s for \nSwiss social security or regul atory purposes, a recent Spanish re gulation of food delivery platform s that presumes employment s tatus \nand a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers are employees within th e meaning of the taxi collec tive \nbargaining agreement. As another example, in December 2024, the Mexican Congress passed  a bill to amend Mexico’s Federal Labor ",
          " \n12 \nLaw and reclassify all mobility and delivery earners who make more  than one minimum salary a mont h as employees, with traditional \nlabor law rights, including sharing into the profits of the company. \nIn addition, reclassification of Drivers as  employees, workers or quasi-employees wher e those statuses exist, have and could le ad \nto groups of Drivers becoming represented by labor unions and similar organizations. For example, in May 2021, we formally \nrecognized a UK driver union and in 2024, voters in Massachusetts approved a ballot initiative allowing drivers to collectively bargain \nas independent contractors. If a significa nt number of Drivers were to become uni onized and collective bargaining agreement ter ms \nwere to deviate significantly from our business model, our busin ess, financial condition, operating results and cash flows coul d be \nmaterially adversely affected. In addition, a labor dispute invol ving Drivers may harm our reputa tion, disrupt our operations a nd \nreduce our net revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs. \nIn addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as empl oyees, workers or quasi-employees, this may impact our current \nfinancial statement presentation including revenue, cost of revenue , incentives and promotions as further described in our sign ificant \nand critical accounting po licies in the section titled “Critical Accounting Estimates” included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annu al Report \non Form 10-K and Note 1 in the section titled “Notes to the Cons olidated Financial Statements” in cluded in Part II, Item 8 of t his \nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. \nThe mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been \navailable for decades, low barriers to entr y, low switching costs, and well-capitali zed competitors in nearly every major geogr aphic \nregion. If we are unable to compete effectively in these indust ries, our business and financial prospects would be adversely \nimpacted. \nOur platform provides offerings in the mob ility, delivery, and logistics industries. We compete on a global basis, and the mark ets \nin which we compete are highly fragmented. We face significant competition in each of the mob ility and delivery industries glob ally \nand in the logistics industry in the United States and Canada fro m existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and i n the \nfuture we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers  to entry that characterize these industrie s. In \naddition, within each of these markets, the cost to switch between products is low. Consumers have a propensity to shift to the lowest-\ncost or highest-quality provider; Drivers have a propensity to shift to the plat form with the highest earnings potential; resta urants and \nother merchants have a propensity to shift to the delivery platfo rm that offers the lowest service fee for their meals and othe r goods \nand provides the highest volume of orders; and Shippers and Carriers have a propensity  to shift to the platform with the best price and \nmost convenient service for hauling shipments. \nFurther, while we work to expand globally and introduce new pr oducts and offerings across a range  of industries, many of our \ncompetitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialize d \nexpertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do.  As we and our competitors  introduce new products and \nofferings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. In addition, our competitors  may \nadopt certain of our product features, or may adopt innovations that Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers valu e more \nhighly than ours, which would render our products less attractive or reduce our ability to diff erentiate our products. Increase d \ncompetition could result in, among other things, a reduction of the revenue we generate from the use of our platform, the numbe r of \nplatform users, the frequency of use of our platform, and our margins. \nWe face competition in each of our offerings, including: \n• Mobility. Our Mobility offering compet es with personal vehicle ow nership and usage, which a ccounts for the majority of \npassenger miles in the markets that we serve, and traditio nal transportation services, including taxicab companies and \ntaxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. In addition,  public transportation can be a superior substitute to our \nMobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower- cost travel option in many cities. We also compete with \nother ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned entities, for Drivers and riders, including Bolt, Didi, \nGrab, Lyft, and Ola. \n• Delivery. Our Delivery offering competes with numerous companies in the meal, grocery and other delivery space in \nvarious regions for Drivers, consumers, and merchants, in cluding DoorDash, Deliveroo, Glovo, Instacart, Gopuff, Rappi, \niFood, Delivery Hero, Just Eat Takeaway, and Amazon. Our Delivery offering also competes with restaurants and other \nmerchants, including those that offer their own delivery and/or  take-away, meal kit delivery services, grocery delivery \nservices, and traditional grocers. \n• Freight. Our Freight offering competes with global and Nort h American freight brokers and managed transportation \nproviders such as C.H. Robinson, Total Quality Logistics, RXO, XPO, Echo Global Logistics, DHL, and NEXT Trucking. \nMany of our competitors are well-capitalized and offer disc ounted services, Driver incentiv es, consumer discounts and \npromotions, innovative products and offerings, and alternative pric ing models, which may be more attractive to consumers than t hose \nthat we offer. Further, some of our current or potential competitors have, and may in the future continue to have, greater reso urces and \naccess to larger Driver, consumer, merchant, Shipper, or Carrier  bases in a particular geographic market. In addition, our comp etitors \nin certain geographic markets en joy substantial competitive adva ntages such as greater brand recognition, longer operating hist ories, \nlarger marketing budgets, better localized knowledge, and more s upportive regulatory regimes. As a result, such competitors may  be ",
          " \n13 \nable to respond more quickly and effectively than us in such markets to new or changing oppor tunities, technologies, consumer \npreferences, regulations, or standards, wh ich may render our products or offerings less attractive. In addition, future competi tors may \nshare in the eff ective benefit of any regulatory or governmental approvals and litigation victories we may achieve, without hav ing to \nincur the costs we have incurred to obtain such benefits. \nAs a result of certain divestitures, we are contractually restri cted from competing with our cu rrent or former minority-owned \nentities with respect to certain aspects of our business, including in Southe ast Asia through one year after we dispose of all interests in \nGrab, and the Middle East, North Africa and Pakistan through two y ears after we dispose of all interests in Careem Technologies , \nwhile our minority-owned entities are not nece ssarily restricted from competing with us anywhere in the world. In addition, we are \ncontractually restricted from competing with some of our majority-owned entities with respect to certain aspects of our busines s, \nincluding competing against Uber Freight with respect to freight brokerage. \nAdditionally, if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval of  any acquisitions, we  may not ultimately consummate such \nacquisitions, may be required to pay termination fees or may cons ummate them only in jurisdicti ons where antitrust approval is \nobtained. Further, in order to obtain regulat ory approval of acquisitions, we may be requi red to divest all or part of our or t he target \ncompany’s operations or agree to other remedies. Any such remedies could result in additional competition in some or all markets. \nFor all of these reasons, we may not be ab le to compete successfully against our current and future  competitors. Our inability to \ncompete effectively would have an adverse effect on, or otherwise harm, our business, financial condition, and operating results. \nTo remain competitive in certai n markets, we have in the past lowered, and may co ntinue to lower, fares or service fees, and we  \nhave in the past offered, and may continue to offer, significant  Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions, which  \nhas adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our financial performance. \nTo remain competitive in certain markets and generate network scale and liquidity, we have in the past lowered, and may continue \nto lower, fares or service fees, and we have offered and may c ontinue to offer significant Driver incentives and consumer disco unts \nand promotions. At times, in certain geographic markets, we have offered, and may continue to offer, Driver incentives that cau se the \ntotal amount of the fare that a Driver retains, combined with the Driver incentives a Driver receives from us, to increase, at times \nmeeting or exceeding the amount of Gross Bookings we generate for a given Trip. In certain geographic markets and regions, we d o \nnot have a leading category position, which ma y result in us choosing to further increase the amount of Driver incentives and \nconsumer discounts and promotions that we offer in those geographic markets and regions. We cannot assure you that offering suc h \nDriver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions will be successful. Driver incentives, consumer discounts, promotions, and \nreductions in fares and our service fee have negatively affected , and will continue to negativ ely affect, our financial perform ance. \nAdditionally, we rely on pricing models to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings, which have been modified over time and will \nlikely in the future be modified, and pric ing models at times vary based upon jurisdiction. We cannot assure you that our prici ng \nmodels or strategies will be successful in attracting consumers a nd Drivers. For example, changes we have made in California to  the \ninformation that Drivers see in the application, as well as pricing and offer st ructure changes, adversely impacted usage of th e \napplication. If we are unable to successfully manage these and similar kinds of changes in the future, our business may be adve rsely \nimpacted. \nThe markets in which we compete have attracted significant inve stments from a wide range of f unding sources, and we anticipate \nthat many of our competitors will continue to be highly capitalized. Moreover, certain of our stockholders ha ve made substantia l \ninvestments in certain of our co mpetitors and may increase such investments, make  new investments in other competitors, or ente r \ninto strategic transactions  with competitors in the future. These investments or strategic tr ansactions, along with other compe titive \nadvantages discussed above, may allow our compe titors to compete more effe ctively against us and con tinue to lower their prices , \noffer Driver incentives or consumer discounts and promotions, or otherwise attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and  \nCarriers to their platform and away from our s. Such competitive pres sures may lead us to maintain or lower fares or service fee s or \nmaintain or increase our Driver incentives and consumer disc ounts and promotions. Ridesharing a nd certain other categories in w hich \nwe compete are rela tively nascent, and we cannot  guarantee that they will  stabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allo w us to \nmaintain profitability. \nWe have incurred significant losses, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses t o \nincrease in the foreseeable future, and we may not maintain profitability. \nWe incurred an operating loss of $1.8 b illion in the year ended December 31, 2022, and as of December 31, 2024, we had an \naccumulated deficit of $20.7 billion. We will need to generate and sust ain increased revenue  levels and decr ease proportionate \nexpenses in future periods to achieve or maintain profitabilit y in many of our largest markets, including in the United States,  and even \nif we do, we may not be able to  maintain or increase profitabili ty. We may incur losses in the near term as a result of substan tial \nincreases in our operating expenses, as we continue to invest in  order to: increase the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants , \nShippers, and Carriers using our platform  through incentives, discounts, and promotions; expand within existing or into new mar kets; \nincrease our research and development expenses; expand marketi ng channels and operations; hire additional employees; and add ne w \nproducts and offerings to our platform. These efforts may prove mo re expensive than we anticipate, and we may not succeed in \nincreasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these expenses. Ma ny of our efforts to generate revenue are new and unproven, and  any \nfailure to adequately increase revenue or contain the related costs could prevent us from attaining or increasing profitability . In ",
          " \n14 \naddition, we sometimes introduce new products that we expect to add value to our overall platform and network but which we expe ct \nwill generate lower Gross Bookings per Trip or a lower Revenue Margin. Further, we ma y charge a lower service fee to certain of our \nmerchant partners on our Delivery offering to grow the number of  Delivery consumers, which may at times result in a negative \nRevenue Margin with respect to those transactions after consid ering amounts collected from consumers and paid to Drivers. As we  \nexpand our offerings to additional cities, our offerings in these ci ties may be less profitable than the markets in which we cu rrently \noperate. As such, we may not be able to maintain profitability in the near term, in accordance with our expectations, or at all . \nAdditionally, we may not realize the operating efficiencies we expe ct to achieve as a result of our prior or future acquisition s. Even if \nwe do experience operating efficiencies, our operating results may not improve, at least in the near term. \nIf we are unable to attract or maintain a sufficient number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, whether as a \nresult of competition or other factors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users, and our financial results would be \nadversely impacted. \nOur success in a given geographic market significantly depends on our ability to develop our network scale and liquidity in tha t \ngeographic market by attracting Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers to our platform. If Drivers choose not to  offer \ntheir services through our platform, we may lack a sufficient supply of Drivers to attract consumers and merchants to our platform. We \nhave experienced and expect to continue to experience Driver supply constraints in most geographic markets in which we operate.  To \nthe extent that we experience Driver supply constraints in a given market, we may need to increase or may not be able to reduce  the \nDriver incentives that we offer without adversely affecting the supply liquidity that we experience in that market. Similarly, if Carriers \nchoose not to offer their services through our platform or elect to use other freight brokers, we may lack a sufficient supply of Carriers \nin specific geographic markets to attract Shippers to our platfo rm. Furthermore, if merchants choose to partner with other deli very \nservices in a specific geographic market, or if merchants choose to engage exclusively with our competitors, other merchant marketing \nwebsites, or other delivery services, we may lack a sufficient variety and supply of restaurant and other merchant options, or lack \naccess to the most popular merchants, such that our Delivery offering w ill become less appealing to consumers and merchants. A \nsignificant amount of our Delivery Gross B ookings come from a limited number of large re staurant groups and other merchants, an d \nthis concentration increases the risk of fluctuations in our op erating results and our sensitivity to any material adverse deve lopments \nexperienced by our significant merchant partners. If platform us ers choose to use other rideshari ng, delivery, or logistics ser vices, we \nmay lack sufficient opportunities for Driver s to earn a fare, Carriers to  book a shipment, or mercha nts to provide their goods,  which \nmay reduce the perceived utility of our platform. An insufficient  supply of platform users woul d decrease our network liquidity  and \nadversely affect our revenue and financial results. Although we may benefit from having larger scale and liquidity than some \ncompetitors, those network effects may not result in competitive advantages or may be overcome by smaller competitors. Maintain ing \na balance between supply and demand in any given area at any give n time and our ability to execute operationally may be more \nimportant to service quality than  the absolute size of the network. If our servi ce quality diminishes or  our competitors’ produ cts \nachieve greater market adopt ion, our competitors may be able to  grow at a quicker rate than we  do and may diminish our network \neffect. \nOur number of platform users may decline materially or fluctuate as a result of many factors, including, among other things, \ndissatisfaction with the operation of our platform, the price of fares, food, and sh ipments (including a reduction in incentives), broader \neconomic and labor market dynamics, changes in government policy,  dissatisfaction with the quality of service provided by the \nDrivers and merchants on our platform, quality  of platform user support, dissatisfac tion with the merchant selection on Deliver y, \nnegative publicity related to our brand, including as a result of  safety incidents and corporate reporting related to safety, p erceived \npolitical or geopolitical aff iliations, a pandemic or an outbreak of disease or similar public heal th concern, or fear of such an event, \ntreatment of Drivers, perception that our culture has not fundame ntally changed, dissatisfaction with changes we make to our pr oducts \nand offerings, or dissatisf action with our products a nd offerings in general. In addition,  if we are unable to provide high-qua lity \nsupport to platform users or respond to reported incidents, includi ng safety incidents, in a timely and acceptable manner, our ability to \nattract and retain platform users could be adversely affected. If Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers do not establish \nor maintain active accounts with us, if a social media or other campaign encouraging us ers to cease use of our platform takes h old, if \nwe fail to provide high-quality support, or if we  cannot otherwise attract and retain a la rge number of Drivers, consumers, mer chants, \nShippers, and Carriers, our revenue would decline, and our business would suffer. \nThe number of Drivers and merchants on our platform could decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including \nDrivers ceasing to provide thei r services through our platform, passage or enforcement of loca l laws limiting our products and \nofferings, the low switching costs between competitor platforms or  services, and dissatisfaction with our brand or reputation, pricing \nmodels (including potential reductions in incentives), ability to prevent safety incidents, or other aspects of our business. W hile we \naim to provide an earnings opportunity comparable to that availabl e in retail, wholesale, or merchant services or other similar  work, \nwe continue to experience dissatisfaction with our platform from a significant number of Drivers. In particular, as we aim to r educe \nDriver incentives to improve our financial performance, we expect Driver dissatisfaction will generally increase. \nOften, we are forced to make tradeoffs between the satisfaction of  various platform users, as a change that one category of use rs \nviews as positive will likely be viewed as negative to another cate gory of users. We also take certain measures to protect against fraud, \nhelp increase safety, and prevent privacy and security breaches, including terminating access to our platform for users with lo w ratings \nor reported incidents, and imposing certain qualifications for Dr ivers and merchants, which may damage our relationships with ",
          " \n15 \nplatform users or discourage or diminish their use of our platform. Further, we are investing in our autonomous vehicle strategy, which \nmay add to Driver dissatisfaction over time, as it may reduce the need for Drivers. Driver dissat isfaction has in the past resu lted in \nprotests by Drivers in various regions, incl uding India, the United Kingdom, and the Un ited States. Such protests have resulted , and \nany future protests may result, in interruptions to our business.  Continued Driver dissatisfaction may also result in a decline  in our \nnumber of platform users, which would reduc e our network liquidity, and which in turn may cause a further decline in platform u sage. \nAny decline in the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shi ppers, or Carriers using our plat form would reduce the value of our \nnetwork and would harm our future operating results. \nIn addition, changes in Driver qualification and background-check  requirements may increase our costs and reduce our ability to  \nonboard additional Drivers to our platform. Our Driver qualification and background check process vari es by jurisdiction, and t here \nhave been allegations, including from regulat ors, legislators, prosecuto rs, taxicab owners, and consumers, that our background check \nprocess is insufficient or inadequate. With  respect to Drivers who are only eligible to make deliveries through Delivery, our \nqualification and background check standards are generally less ex tensive than the standards for Drivers who are eligible to pr ovide \nrides through our Mobility products. Legislators and re gulators may pass laws or  adopt regulations in the future requiring Driv ers to \nundergo a materially different type of qua lification, screening, or background check process, or  that limit our  ability to acce ss \ninformation used in the background check process in an efficien t manner, which could be costly and time-consuming. Required \nchanges in the qualification, screening, and background check pro cess (including any changes to such processes of Careem, Postm ates \nor other acquired companies) could also reduce the number of Dr ivers in those markets or extend the time required to recruit ne w \nDrivers to our platform, which would advers ely impact our business and growth. Furthe rmore, we rely on a single background-chec k \nprovider in certain jurisdictions, and we may not be able to a rrange for adequate background checks from a different provider o n \ncommercially reasonable terms or at all. The failure of this provider to provide background checks on a timely basis would resu lt in \nour inability to onboard new Drivers or re tain existing Drivers undergoi ng periodic background checks that are required to cont inue \nusing our platform. \nMaintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We receive significant media coverage , \nincluding negative publicity regarding our br and and reputation, and while we have t aken significant steps to rehabilitate our \nbrand and reputation, failure to maintain or enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer. \nMaintaining and enhancing our  brand and reputation is critical to our ability to attract new employees and platform users, to \npreserve and deepen the engageme nt of our existing employees and platform users, and to mitigate legislative or regulatory scru tiny, \nlitigation, government investigations, and adverse platform user sentiment. \nWe receive a high degree of negative media coverage around the world, which adversely affects our brand and reputation and \nfuels distrust of our company. Negative publicity adversely affects our brand and reput ation, makes it difficult for us to attr act and \nretain platform users, reduces confidence in and use of our products and offerings, invites continued legislative and regulator y \nscrutiny, and results in additional litigation and governmental i nvestigations. As a result, our competitors raised additional capital, \nincreased their investments in certain markets, and improved their category positions and market shares, and may continue to do so. \nIn 2024, we released a third safety report, which provides the publ ic with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other  \ncritical safety incidents claimed to have  occurred on our platform in the United Stat es. Public responses to our safety reports  or any \nfuture safety reports or similar public re porting of safety incidents claimed to have  occurred on our platform, which may inclu de \ndisclosure of reports provided to regulator s and other government authorities, as well  as public responses to any third-party \nassessments of our civil rights impact, may continue to resu lt in positive and negative media c overage, increased regulatory sc rutiny, \nand litigation, and could a dversely affect our reputation with platform users.  Media coverage of litig ation and of regulatory s crutiny \ncan also adversely affect our reputation and brand. Further unfavorable media coverage and negative publicity of these and other kinds \ncould adversely impact our financial results and future prospect s. As our platform continues to scale and becomes increasingly \ninterconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public aw areness of our brand, future damage to our brand and reputat ion \ncould have an amplified effect on our va rious platform offerings. Additionally, some of our acquired and majority-owned compani es, \nincluding Careem, Postmates and Corn ershop, have or will continue to  use their own brands  and/or operate their own apps in para llel \nwith our brand and apps, and any damage or reputational harm to their brands could adversely impact our brand and reputation. \nOur brand and reputation might also be harmed by events outside of our control. For example, we have licensed our brand in \nconnection with certain divestitures and join t ventures, including to Yandex in Russia/CI S, and while we have certain contractu al \nprotections in place governing the use of our brand by these companies, we do not control these businesses, we are not able to \nanticipate their actions, and consumers may not be aware that th ese service providers are not controlled by us. Furthermore, if  Drivers, \nmerchants, or Carriers provide diminished quality of service, ar e involved in incidents regarding safety or privacy, engage in \nmalfeasance, or otherwise violate the law, we may receive unf avorable press coverage and our reputation and business may be \nharmed. As a result, any of these third parties could take actions  that result in harm to our brand, reputation, and consequent ly, our \nbusiness. \nWhile we have taken significant steps to re habilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will  \ndepend largely on maintaining a good reputation,  minimizing the number of safety incide nts, continuing an improved culture and \nworkplace practices, improving our compliance programs, continuing to invest in safety features and improvements, maintaining a  ",
          " \n16 \nhigh quality of service and ethi cal behavior, and continuing our marketing and public relations efforts. Our brand promotion, \nreputation building, and media strategies have involved significant costs and may not be successful. We anticipate that other \ncompetitors and potential competitors will e xpand their offerings, which will make main taining and enhanci ng our reputation and  \nbrand increasingly more difficult and expensive. If we fail to su ccessfully maintain our brand in the current or future competi tive \nenvironment or if events occur in the future which negatively affect public perception of our company, our brand and reputation would \nbe further damaged and our business may suffer. \n \nIf we fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platfo rm or fail to offer such technologies on our platform before o ur \ncompetitors, or if such technologies fail to perform as expected, are inferior to those offered by our competitors, or are perceived as \nless safe than those offered by competitors or non-autonomo us vehicles, our financial perf ormance and prospects would be \nadversely impacted. \nWe have invested, and we may continue to invest, substantial amounts in companies with whom we partner to offer autonomous \nvehicle technologies on our platform. For ex ample, in January 2021, we completed th e merger of our au tonomous technologies \nbusiness with Aurora, and included a $400 million investment in the combined company and a commercial agreement pursuant to \nwhich we and Aurora will collaborate with respect to the launc h and commercialization of self-d riving vehicles on our rideshari ng \nnetwork. Additionally, we have en tered into commercial pa rtnerships with various  autonomous mobility and/ or autonomous delivery  \ncompanies. We believe that autonomous vehi cle technologies may ha ve the ability to meaningfully impact the industries in which we \ncompete and that autonomous vehi cles present substantia l opportunities. Several companies other than Au rora, including Waymo, \nTesla, Zoox (a subsidiary of Amazon), Motional, Avride and Nu ro, are developing autonomous vehi cle technologies in the United \nStates, either alone or through collaborations with car manufacturers, as are similar companies globally, and we expect that th ey will \nuse such technology to further compete with us in the mobili ty, delivery, or logistics industries. Waymo has introduced a \ncommercialized ridehail ing fleet of autonomous vehi cles on its own platform in addition to  a fleet of autonom ous vehicles that it \nmakes available through our platform, and it is possible that our competitors could introduce autonomous vehicle offerings earlier than \nwe will be able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform or that our commercial partnerships could expire or that our autonomous \nvehicle partners could experience organizati onal failures of their own or otherwise remove their vehicles from our platform. In  the \nevent that our competitors bring autonomous ve hicles to market before we are able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform,  \ndeploy their autonomous vehicles on rideshari ng, delivery or logistics platforms other than ours, or their technology is or is perceived \nto be superior to the technology of parties with which we partne r to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, they may be abl e to \nleverage such technology to compete more effectively with us, which would adversely impact our  financial performance and our \nprospects. For example, use of autonomous vehicles could substa ntially reduce the cost of providi ng ridesharing, delivery, or logistics \nservices, which could allow competitors to offer such services at  a substantially lower price as compared to the price availabl e to \nconsumers on our platform. If a significant number of consumers choose to use our competitors’ of ferings over ours,  our financi al \nperformance and prospects would be adversely impacted. \nAutonomous vehicle technologies involve significant risks and lia bilities. Collisions, including fatal collis ions, have happene d. \nFailures of autonomous vehicle technologies that we may offer on our platform or cras hes involving autonomou s vehicles using th e \ntechnology of our partners, could generate substantial liability  for us, create negative publicity about us, or result in regul atory \nscrutiny, all of which would have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, prospects, and operating results. \nFederal and state government regulations specifically desi gned to govern autonomous vehicl e operation, testing and/or \nmanufacture are developing. These regulations could include requirements that delay or limit our ability to offer autonomous ve hicles \non our platform. If regulations of this nature are implemented, we may not be able to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our \nplatform in the manner we expect, or at all. Further, if we or  parties with which we partner to offer autonomous vehicle techno logies \nare unable to comply with existing or new regulations or laws a pplicable to autonomous vehicles, we and our partners could beco me \nsubject to substantial fines or penalties. \nOur workforce and operations have grown substantially since our inception and we have in the past implemented several \nreductions in workforce. If we are unable to optimize our organiz ational structure or effectively manage our growth or any futu re \nreductions in workforce, our financial performance and future prospects will be adversely affected. \nSince our inception, we have experienced rapid growth in the United States and internationally. This expansion increases the \ncomplexity of our business and has placed, and will continue to place, significant st rain on our manageme nt, personnel, operati ons, \nsystems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal  financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able  to \nmanage our growth effectively, which could damage our reputation and negatively affect our operating results. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 31,100 global em ployees, of whom approximately 18,000 were located outside \nthe United States. The total number of our employees located outsi de the United States has increased and may continue to increa se as \nwe expand globally. Properl y managing our growth will require us  to continue to hire, train, and manage qualified employees and  \nstaff, including engineers, ope rations personnel, fi nancial and accounting staff,  and sales and marketi ng staff, and to improve  and \nmaintain our technology. If our new hires perform poorly, if we ar e unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing, and integrating  new \nemployees and staff, or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees and staff, our business may be harmed. Mor eover, \nin order to optimize our organizational structure, we have implemented several reductions in workforce and restructurings, and may in ",
          " \n17 \nthe future implement other reductions in wo rkforce. Any reduction in workforce or re structuring may yield unintended consequenc es \nand costs, such as attrition beyond the intended reduction in wo rkforce, the distraction of employees, or reduced employee morale and \ncould adversely affect our reputa tion as an employer, which could make it more di fficult for us to hire new employees in the fu ture \nand increase the risk that we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the reduction in workforce. Properly managing our g rowth \nor any reductions in workforce will require us to establish consistent policies across regions and functions, and a failure to do so could \nlikewise harm our business. \nOur failure to upgrade our technology or netw ork infrastructure effectively to support our growth could result in unanticipated  \nsystem disruptions, slow response times, or poor experiences for Dr ivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers. To mana ge \nthe growth of our operations and personnel and improve the tec hnology that supports our business ope rations, as well as our fin ancial \nand management systems, disclosu re controls and procedur es, and internal controls  over financial reporti ng, we will be required  to \ncommit substantial financial, operational, and technical resources. In particular, we will need to improve our transaction proc essing \nand reporting, operational, and financial systems, procedures, and controls. For example, due to our significant growth, especially with \nrespect to our high-growth emerging offerings like Delivery and Freight, we face challenges in timely and appropriately designi ng \ncontrols in response to evolving risks of material misstatement. These improvements are and will be particularly challenging when we \nacquire new businesses with different systems. Our current and pl anned personnel, systems, procedures, and controls may not be \nadequate to support our future operations. If we are unable to  expand our operations and hire additional qualified personnel in  an \nefficient manner, or if our operational tec hnology is insufficient to reliably service Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers,  or \nCarriers, platform user satisfaction will be adversely affected a nd may cause platform users to sw itch to our competitors’ platforms, \nwhich would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. \nOur organizational structure is complex and w ill continue to grow as we add additional Drivers, consumers, merchants, Carriers,  \nShippers, employees, products and offerings, a nd technologies, and as we continue to ex pand globally. We will need to improve o ur \noperational, financial, and management controls as well as our  reporting systems and procedures to support the growth of our \norganizational structure. We will require ca pital and management resource s to grow and mature in these areas. If we are unable to \neffectively manage the growth of our busine ss, the quality of our platform may suffer, and we may be unable to address competit ive \nchallenges, which would adversely affect our overall business, operations, and financial condition. \nOur historical workplace culture and forw ard-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges, and a \nfailure to address these challenges would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects. \nOur historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created significant operational and cultural challenges that have  in \nthe past harmed, and may in the future continue to harm, our bu siness results and financial cond ition. Our prior failure to pri oritize \ncompliance has led to increased regulatory scrutiny globally. Althoug h we have since made changes in our company’s cultural val ues \nand composition of our leadership team and have an ongoing commitment to promote tran sparency and collaboration, regulators may \ncontinue to perceive us negatively, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.  \nIf platform users engage in, or are subject to, criminal, violen t, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major s afety \nincidents, our ability to attract and retain  Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers , and Carriers may be harmed, which could \nhave an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, and operating results. \nWe are not able to control or predict the actions of platform users and third parties, either during their use of our platform or \notherwise, and we may be unable to protec t or provide a safe environment for Driver s and consumers as a result of certain actio ns by \nDrivers, consumers, merchants, Carriers, and third parties. Su ch actions may result in injuries, property damage, or loss of li fe for \nconsumers and third parties, or business interruption, brand and reput ational damage, or significant liabilities for us. Althou gh we \nadminister certain qualification processes for users of our platform, including background check s on Drivers through third-part y \nservice providers in the United States, these qualification pr ocesses and background checks may not expose all potentially rele vant \ninformation and are limited in certain jurisdictions according to national and local laws, and our third-party service provider s where \nutilized may fail to conduct such background checks ade quately or disclose information that could be relevant to a determinatio n of \neligibility. Further, the qualification and background check standards for Couriers are generally less extensive than those conducted for \nMobility Drivers. In addition, we do not in dependently test Drivers’ driving skills. Cons equently, we expect to continue to rec eive \ncomplaints from riders and other consumers, as well as actual or  threatened legal action against us related to Driver conduct. We have \nalso faced civil litigation alleging, among other things, inadequate Driver qualifica tion processes and background checks, and general \nmisrepresentations regarding the safety of our platform. \nIf Drivers or Carriers, or individuals impe rsonating Drivers or Carriers, engage in criminal activity, misconduct, or inappropr iate \nconduct or use our platform as a conduit for criminal activity, consumers and Shippers may not consider our products and offeri ngs \nsafe, and we may receive negative press coverage as a result of our business relationship with such Driver or Carrier, which wo uld \nadversely impact our brand, reputation, and business. There have  been numerous incidents and allegations worldwide of Drivers, or \nindividuals impersonating Drivers,  sexually assaulting, abusing, kidnapping and/or fatally injuri ng consumers, or otherwise eng aging \nin criminal activity while using our platfo rm or claiming to use our platform. Furtherm ore, if consumers engage in criminal act ivity or \nmisconduct while using our platform, Drivers and merchants may be unwilli ng to continue using our pl atform. In addition, certai n \nregions where we operate have high rates of  violent crime, which has impacted Drivers and consumers in those regions. For examp le, ",
          " \n18 \nin Latin America, there have been numerous reports of Drivers and consumers being victimized by violent crime, such as armed \nrobbery, violent assault, and rape, while ta king or providing a trip on our platform. If other criminal, inappropriate, or othe r negative \nincidents occur due to the conduct of platform users or third part ies, our ability to attract platform users may be harmed, and  our \nbusiness and financial results could be adversely affected. \nPublic reporting or disclosure of reported safety information, including information about safety incidents reportedly occurring on \nor related to our platform, whether generated by us or third parties such as media or regulators, may adversely impact our business and \nfinancial results. \nFurther, we may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accide nts, deaths, injuries, or other incidents that are \ncaused by Drivers, consumers, or third partie s while using our platform, or even when Drivers, consumers, or third parties are not \nactively using our platform. On a smaller scale, we may face litigation related to claims by Drivers for the actions of consume rs or \nthird parties. Furthermore, operating a moto r vehicle is inherently dangerous. In addi tion, the growth of our Delivery offering  and \nlaunch of lower-cost product types has led to an increase in Dr ivers and consumers on two wheel vehicles such as scooters and \nbicycles, who are more vulnerable road users and face a more severe level of injury in  the event of a collision than that faced  while \ndriving in a vehicle. For example, urban hazards such as unpaved or uneven roadways increase the risk and severity of potential  \ninjuries. In addition, Drivers, in particular those on two wheel vehicles predominantly in metropolitan areas, need to share, n avigate, \nand at times contend with narrow and heavily congested roads o ccupied by cars, buses and light rail, especially during “rush” h ours, \nall of which heighten the potential risk of  injuries or death. Our auto liability and general liability insurance policies may not cover all \npotential claims to which we are exposed, and may not be adequate  to indemnify us for all liab ility. These incidents may subject us to \nliability, negative publicity, and regulatory scrutiny, which would increase our operating costs and adversely affect our busin ess, \noperating results, and future prospects. Ev en if these claims do not result in liab ility, we will incur significant costs in in vestigating \nand defending against them. As we expand our products and offerings, this insurance risk will grow. \nWe are making substantial investments in new offerings and techno logies, and may increase such in vestments in the future. These \nnew ventures are inherently risky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them. \nWe have made substantial investments to develop new offerings and technologies, and we intend to  continue investing significant \nresources in developing new technologies, to ols, features, services, products and offe rings. For example, through our acquisiti on of \nCornershop, a provider of online grocery delivery in several countries including Mexico and Chile, we expanded our Delivery offering \nto grocery delivery. Additionally, in October 2021, we acquired Th e Drizly Group, Inc. in order to further expand our Delivery \noffering to alcohol. In November 2021, our subsidiary Uber Frei ght acquired Transplace, expanding Uber Freight’s business throu gh \nTransplace’s expertise in transportation mana gement. We also plan to invest resource s to develop offerings and technologies in the \nmarkets in which Postmates operate. If we do not spend our development budget efficiently or effectively on commercially succes sful \nand innovative technologies, we may not realize th e expected benefits of our  strategy. Our new initiati ves also have a high deg ree of \nrisk, as each involves nascent industries and unproven business stra tegies and technologies with which we have limited or no pr ior \ndevelopment or operating e xperience. Because such offerings and technologies are new, they w ill likely involve claims and liabilities \n(including, but not limited to, personal injury claims), expenses , regulatory challenges, and other risks, some of which we do not \ncurrently anticipate. \nThere can be no assurance that consumer demand for such initiatives will exist or be sustained at the levels that we anticipate , or \nthat any of these initiatives will gain sufficient traction or ma rket acceptance to generate sufficient revenue to offset any n ew expenses \nor liabilities associated with these new investments. It is also possible that  products and offerings developed by others will render our \nproducts and offerings noncompetitive or obsolete. Further, our de velopment efforts with respect to new products, offerings and  \ntechnologies could distract management from current operations, and will divert capital and other resources from our more established \nproducts, offerings and technologies. Even if  we are successful in developing new pr oducts, offerings or technologies, regulato ry \nauthorities may subject us to new rules or restrictions in re sponse to our innovations that coul d increase our expenses or prev ent us \nfrom successfully commercializing new products, offerings or tec hnologies. If we do not realize the expected benefits of our \ninvestments, our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects may be harmed. \nOur business is substantially dependent on  operations outside the United States, incl uding those in markets in which we have \nlimited experience, and if we are unable to manage the risks pr esented by our business model in ternationally, our financial results \nand future prospects will be adversely impacted. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we operated in over 70 countries. We  have limited experience operating in many jurisdictions outside \nof the United States and have made, and expect to continue to  make, significant investments to expand our international operati ons \nand compete with local and other global competitors. \nConducting our business internationally, particularly in countries in which we have limited experience, subjects us to risks th at we \ndo not face to the same degree in the United States. These risks include, among others: \n• operational and compliance challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences; \n• the resources required to localize our business, which requires the translation of our mobile app and website into foreign \nlanguages and the adaptation of our operations to local practices , laws, and regulations and any changes in such practices, ",
          " \n19 \nlaws, and regulations; \n• laws and regulations more restrictive than those in the United States, including laws governing competition, pricing, \npayment methods, Internet activities, tran sportation services (such as taxis and ve hicles for hire), transportation network \ncompanies (such as ridesharing), logistics services, payment processing and payment gateways, real estate tenancy laws, \ntax and social security laws, employment and labor laws, dr iver screening and background checks, licensing regulations, \nemail messaging, privacy, location services, collection, use, pr ocessing, or sharing of personal information, ownership of \nintellectual property, and other activities important to our business; \n• competition with companies or other services (such as taxis or  vehicles for hire) that understand local markets better than \nwe do, that have pre-existing relationships with potentia l platform users in those markets, or that are favored by \ngovernment or regulatory authorities in those markets; \n• differing levels of social acceptance of our brand, products, and offerings; \n• differing levels of technological compatibility with our platform; \n• exposure to business cultures in which improper business practices may be prevalent; \n• legal uncertainty regarding our liability for the actions of pl atform users and third parties,  including uncertainty resulting \nfrom unique local laws or a lack of clear legal precedent; \n• difficulties in managing, growing, and staffing international operations, including in countries in which foreign employees \nmay become part of labor unions, empl oyee representative bodies, or collectiv e bargaining agreements, and challenges \nrelating to work stoppages or slowdowns; \n• fluctuations in currency exchange rates; \n• managing operations in markets in which cash transactions are favored over credit or debit cards; \n• regulations governing the control of local currencies that impact our ability to collect fares on beha lf of Drivers and remit \nthose funds to Drivers in the same currencies, as well as higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud; \n• adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added and digital services tax systems, and \nrestrictions on the repatriation of earnings; \n• increased financial accounting and reporting burdens, and comp lexities associated with implementing and maintaining \nadequate internal controls; \n• difficulties in implementing and maintaining the financial systems and processes needed to enable compliance across \nmultiple offerings and jurisdictions; \n• import and export restrictions and changes in trade regulation; \n• political, social, and economic in stability abroad, war, including the conflict between Russia a nd Ukraine and conflicts in \nthe Middle East, terrorist attacks and security concerns in gene ral, and societal crime conditions that harm or disrupt the \nglobal economy and/or can directly impact platform users; \n• public health concerns or emergencies, including pandemi cs and other highly communicab le diseases or viruses, \noutbreaks of which have from time to time occurred in various parts of the world in which we operate; and \n• reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some markets. \nThese risks could adversely affect our international operations, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial \ncondition, and operating results. \nWe have limited influence over our minority-owned entities, which subjects us to substantial risks, including potential loss of value. \nOur growth strategy has included the restructuring of our busines s and assets by divesting our business and assets in certain \njurisdictions and partnering with and investing in local rideshar ing, and delivery companies to participate in those markets ra ther than \noperate in those markets independently. Our growth strategy has al so included the divestment of certain lines of business in th eir \nentirety, and not just in certain jurisdic tions, and instead partnering and investing in  other companies in those lines of busi ness. As a \nresult, a significant portion of our assets includes minority ownership positions, including in Didi, Grab, and Aurora. \nOur ownership in these entities involves si gnificant risks that are outside our control. As a result, these companies may make \ndecisions or take actions with which we disagree or that may be harmful to the value of our ownership in these companies. \nAdditionally, these companies have expanded their offerings, and we expect them to continue to expand their offerings in the fu ture. \nWhile this could enhance the value of our ownership interest in  these companies, our business, financial condition, operating r esults, \nand prospects would be adversely affected by such expansion. ",
          " \n20 \nAny material decline in the business of these entities would adve rsely affect the value of our assets and our financial results . \nFurthermore, the value of these assets is based in part on the market valuations of  these entities, and weakened financial mark ets have \nadversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect such valuations. To the extent these businesses are or become public ly \ntraded companies, volatility or fluctuations  in the stock price of such companies c ould adversely impact our financial results.  These \npositions could expose us to risks, litigation, and unknown liabili ties because, among other things, these companies have limit ed \noperating histories in evolving industries an d may have less predictable operating results; to the extent these companies are p rivately \nowned, limited public information is available and we may not l earn all the material information regarding these businesses; ar e \ndomiciled and operate in countries with particular economic, tax, po litical, legal, safety, regulat ory and public health risks;  are \ndomiciled or operate in countries that may become subject to economic sanctions or foreign inve stment restrictions; depend on t he \nmanagement talents and efforts of a small group of individuals, and, as a result, the death, disability, resignation, or termination of one \nor more of these individuals c ould have an adverse effect on the relevant comp any’s operations; and will likely require substan tial \nadditional capital to support their operations and expansion and to maintain their competitive positions. \nFurther, we are contractually lim ited in our ability to sell or tr ansfer these assets. For exampl e, in connection with Aurora’s  \nNovember 2021 initial public offering, we are subject to a 4-year lock-up with respect to our shares in Aurora. Furthermore, we may \nbe required to sell these assets at a time at which we would not be able to realize what we believe to be the long-term value o f these \nassets. For example, if we were deemed an investment comp any under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \n“Investment Company Act”), we may be required to sell some or all of such assets so that we would not be subject to the requirements \nof the Investment Company Act. Additionally, we may have to pa y significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of these assets. \nAccordingly, we may never realize the value of these assets relative to the contributions we made to these businesses. \nWe may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results. If we are unabl e to achieve or sustain profitability, our \nprospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their investment. \nOur operating results may vary significantly and are not necessarily  an indication of future performance. These fluctuations ma y \nbe a result of a variety of factors, some  of which are beyond our control. In additi on, we experience seas onal fluctuations in our \nfinancial results. For Mobility, we typically generate higher reve nue in our fourth quarter compar ed to other quarters due in p art to \nfourth quarter holiday and business demand, and typically generate  lower revenue in our first quarter compared to other quarter s due \nin part to less usage of our platform as holiday demand slows down. We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth \nin Mobility trends in the first quarter. Fo r Delivery, we expect to experience seasona l increases in our revenue in the fourth quarter \ncompared to other quarters, although the historical growth of De livery has masked these seasonal fluctuations. Our growth has m ade, \nand may in the future make, seasonal fluctuations difficult to detect. We expect these seasonal trends to become more pronounced over \ntime as our growth slows. Other seasonal tr ends may develop or these existing seasonal trends may become more extreme, which \nwould contribute to fluctuations in our op erating results. In addition to seasonality , our operating results may fluctuate as a  result of \nfactors including our ability to attract and retain new platform us ers, increased competition in the markets in which we operat e, our \nability to expand our operations in new and existing markets, our ab ility to maintain an adequate growth rate and effectively m anage \nthat growth, our ability to k eep pace with technological change s in the industries in which we  operate, changes in governmental  or \nother regulations affecting our business, harm to our brand or reputation, and other risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on \nForm 10-K. As such, we may not accurately forecast our operating results. We base our expense levels and investment plans on \nestimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quick ly \nenough if our revenue is  less than expected, resulting in lo sses that exceed our expectations . If we are unable to achieve sust ained \nprofits, our prospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their investment.\n \nIf our growth slows more significantly than we currently expe ct, we may not be able to main tain profitability, which would \nadversely affect our financial results and future prospects. \nWe believe that our growth depends on a number of factors, including our ability to: \n• grow supply and demand on our platform; \n• increase existing platform users’ activity on our platform; \n• continue to introduce our platform to new markets; \n• provide high-quality support to Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers; \n• expand our business and increase our market share and category position; \n• compete with the products and offerings of, and pricing and incentives offered by, our competitors; \n• develop new products, offerings, and technologies; \n• identify and acquire or invest in businesses, products, offe rings, or technologies that we believe could complement or \nexpand our platform; \n• penetrate suburban and rural areas and increase the number of rides taken on our platform outside metropolitan areas; ",
          " \n21 \n• reduce the costs of our Mobility offering to better compete with personal vehicle ownership and usage and other low-cost \nalternatives like public transportation, which in many cases can be faster or cheaper than any other form of transportation; \n• maintain existing local regulations in key markets where we operate; \n• enter or expand operations in some of the key countries in which we are currently limited by local regulations, such as \nArgentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain; and \n• increase positive perception of our brand. \nWe may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives. In add ition, circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our \nDelivery offering stemming from stay-at-home order demand related to  the pandemic may not continue in the future. A softening o f \nDriver, consumer, merchant, Shipper, or Carr ier demand, whether caused by changes in th e preferences of such parties, failure t o \nmaintain our brand, changes in the U.S. or global economies, pa ndemics, licensing fees in various  jurisdictions, competition, o r other \nfactors, may result in decreased revenue or growth and our fina ncial results and future prospects would be adversely impacted. We \nexpect to continue to incur significant expenses, and if we cannot increase our revenue at a faster rate than the increase in o ur \nexpenses, we will not achieve or maintain profitability. \nWe generate a significant percentage of ou r Gross Bookings from trips in large metrop olitan areas and trips to and from airport s. \nIf our operations in large metropol itan areas or our ability to pr ovide trips to and from airpor ts are negatively affected, our  \nfinancial results and future prospects would be adversely impacted. \nIn 2024, we derived 20% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from five metr opolitan areas—Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York \nCity in the United States, Sao Paulo in Brazil, and London in  the United Kingdom. We experience strong competition in large \nmetropolitan areas, which has led us to of fer significant Driver incentives and cons umer discounts and promotions in these larg e \nmetropolitan areas. As a result of our geographic concentration,  our business and financial results are susceptible to economic , social, \nweather, and regulatory conditions or other circumstances in each of these large metropolitan areas. Outbreaks of contagious di seases \nor other viruses could lead to a sustained decline in the desirability of living, working and congregating in metropolitan areas in which \nwe operate. Any short-term or l ong-term shifts in the travel patterns of consumers away from metropolitan areas, due to health \nconcerns regarding epidemics or pandemics could have an adve rse impact on our Mobility Gross Bookings from these areas. An \neconomic downturn, increased competition, or  regulatory obstacles in any of these ke y metropolitan areas w ould adversely affect our \nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results to a much great er degree than would the occurrence of such events in other  areas. \nIn addition, any changes to local laws or  regulations within these key metropolitan areas that affect our ability to operate or  increase \nour operating expenses in these markets would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if we are unable to renew existing \nlicenses or do not receive new licenses in key metropolitan areas where we operate or such licenses are terminated, any inabili ty to \noperate in such metropolitan area, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely aff ect our \nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results. \nFurther, we expect that we will continue  to face challenges in pene trating lower-density suburba n and rural areas, where our \nnetwork is smaller and less liquid, the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient. \nIf we are not successful in penetrating suburban and rural areas, or if we are unable to operate in certain key metropolitan ar eas in the \nfuture, our ability to serve what we consider to be our total addressable market would be limited, and our business, financial condition, \nand operating results would suffer. \nIn 2024, we generated 15% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from tr ips that either started or were completed at an airport. As a \nresult of this concentration, our operating results are susceptib le to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability \nof drivers using our platform to  provide trips to and from airports. Sustained dec lines in air travel have in the past, and may  in the \nfuture, suppress demand for airpor t-related Mobility and reduce our Mobility Gross Bookings from ai rport trips. For example, du ring \nthe height of the pandemic, trav el behavior changed and airline travel slowed, reducing th e demand for Mobility to and from air ports. \nCertain airports currently regulate ridesharing within air port boundaries, including by mandating that ridesharing service prov iders \nobtain airport-specific licenses, and some airports, particularly those outside the United States, have banned ridesharing oper ations \naltogether. Despite such bans, some Drivers continue to provide Mobility services, including trips to and from airports, despite lacking \nthe requisite permits. Such actions may result in the imposition of fines or sancti ons, including further bans on our ability t o operate \nwithin airport boundaries, against us or Drivers. Additional bans on our airport operations, or any permitting requirements or instances \nof non-compliance by Drivers, woul d significantly disrupt our  operations. In addition,  if drop-offs or pick -ups of riders becom e \ninconvenient because of airport ru les or regulations, or more e xpensive because of airport-impos ed fees, the number of Drivers or \nconsumers could decrease, which would adversely affect our busin ess, financial condition, and operating results. While we have \nentered into agreements with most major U.S. airports as well as certain airports outside the United States to allow the use of  our \nplatform within airport boundaries, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew such agreements on favorable terms if at all, and \nwe may not be successful in negotiating similar agreements with airports in all jurisdictions. \nOur business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality perso nnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful \nsuccession planning could adversely affect our business. ",
          " \n22 \nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other \npersonnel who are in high demand, are often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for o ur \ncompetitors. Challenges related to our historical culture and workplace practices and negative publicity we experience have in the past \nled to significant attrition and made it more difficult to attr act high-quality employees. Our employees worked from home for a lmost \ntwo years in light of the pandemic, and a lthough we have implemented ou r “return to office” plan, which includes a shift to a h ybrid \nmodel where employees have flexibility to work from home, a hybr id model may create challenges, including challenges maintainin g \nour corporate culture, productivity and avai lability of key personnel and other empl oyees necessary to conduct our business, \nincreasing attrition or limiting our ability to attract employees if individuals prefer to work full time at home or in the off ice. Future \nchallenges related to our culture and wor kplace practices or additional negative publicity could lead  to further attrition and difficulty \nattracting high-quality employees. \nFuture leadership transitions and management changes may cau se uncertainty in, or a disruption to, our business, and may \nincrease the likelihood of senior management  or other employee turnover. The loss of qualified executives and employees, or an \ninability to attract, retain, a nd motivate high-quality executives and employees required for the planned expansion of our busi ness, \nmay harm our operating results and impair our ability to grow. \nIn addition, we depend on the continued services and performan ce of our key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer \nDara Khosrowshahi. We have entered into an employment agreemen t with Mr. Khosrowshahi, which is at-will and has no specific \nduration. \nOur failure to put in place adequate succession plans for senior  and key management roles or the failure of key employees to \nsuccessfully transition into new roles, fo r example, as a result of reductions in workforce, organizational changes and attriti on, could \nhave an adverse effect on our business and operating results. The unexpected or abrupt departure of one or more of our key pers onnel \nand the failure to effectively transfer knowledge and effect sm ooth key personnel transitions has had and may in the future hav e an \nadverse effect on our business resulting from the loss of such person’s skills, knowledge of our business, and years of industr y \nexperience. If we cannot effectivel y manage leadership transitions  and management changes in th e future, our reputation and fut ure \nbusiness prospects could be adversely affected. \nTo attract and retain key personnel, we use equity incentives, among other measures. These measures may not be sufficient to \nattract and retain the personnel we require to operate our busines s effectively. Further, the equity incentives we currently use to attract, \nretain, and motivate employees may not be as effective as in the past, particularly if the value of the underlying stock does not increase \ncommensurate with expectations or consistent with our historical stock price growth. If we are unable to attract and retain hig h-quality \nmanagement and operating personnel, our business, financial condition, and operating results  could be adversely affected. In ad dition, \nwe rely heavily on equity as a component of compensation, whic h may not always align with the Company’s business and financial \ninterests. \nWe have experienced, and may again experience security or privac y breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of,  \ndisclosure of, alteration of or destruction of our proprietary or confidential data, employee data, or platform user data, which could \ncause loss of revenue, harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. \nWe collect, use, and process a variety of personal data, such as email addresses, mobile phone numbers, profile photos, locatio n \ninformation, drivers’ license numbers and Social Security numbers  of Drivers, consumer payment card information, and Driver and  \nmerchant bank account information. As such, we are an attractive target of data security attacks by third parties and insiders.  Any \nfailure to prevent or mitigate security br eaches or improper access to, or use, ac quisition, disclosure, alteration or destruct ion of, any \nsuch data could result in significant liability and a material  loss of revenue resulting from the adverse impact on our reputat ion and \nbrand, a diminished ability to retain or attract new platform users, and disruption to our business. We rely on third-party ser vice \nproviders to host or otherwise process some  of our data and that of platform users,  and they have experienced, and may again \nexperience, security and privacy incidents.  Any failure by such third party to preven t or mitigate security breaches or imprope r access \nto, or use, acquisition, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of, such data could have similar adverse consequences for us. \nBecause the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade services, or sabotage systems change frequently \nand are often unrecognizable until la unched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques and implement adequate \npreventative measures. Our servers, internal systems, and platform  may be vulnerable to computer viruses or physical or electro nic \nbreak-ins that our security measures may no t detect. Individuals able to circumvent our  security measures, or insiders who viol ate our \npolicies, may misappropriate confidential, pr oprietary, or personal information held by  or on behalf of us, disrupt our operati ons, \ndamage our computers, or otherwise damage our business. In add ition, we may need to expend significant resources to protect aga inst \nsecurity breaches or mitigate the impact of any such breaches , including potential liability that may not be limited to the amo unts \ncovered by our insurance. \nSecurity breaches could also expose us to liability under various  laws and regulations across jurisdictions and increase the ri sk of \nlitigation and governmental investigation. We have been subject to security and privacy incidents in the past and may be again in the \nfuture. For example, in September 2022, we experienced a cybersecurity incident where an attacker accessed certain internal corporate \nsystems, tools and data. In Oc tober and November of 2016, outside actors downl oaded the personal data of approximately 57 milli on \nDrivers and consumers worldwide  (the “2016 Breach”). The access ed data included the names, email addresses, mobile phone ",
          " \n23 \nnumbers, and drivers’ license numbers of approximately 600,000 Drivers, among other information.  For further information on thi s \nincident, see the risk factor titled “—We face risks related to  our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing  of data, \nwhich could result in investigations, inqui ries, litigation, fines, legislative, a nd regulatory action, and negative press abou t our privacy \nand data protection practices,” below. As we expand our operati ons, we may also assume liabilities for breaches experienced by the \ncompanies we acquire. For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly  disclosed and notified relevant  regulatory authorities that i t had \nbeen subject to a data security incident that allowed access to  certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platf orm, as of \nJanuary 14, 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result  of this or other data security incidents, or if we fail to  remediate \nthis or any other data security incident that Careem or we e xperience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and \nsignificant liabilities. If we fail to remediate any other data secur ity incident that we experience, we may face harm to our b rand, \nbusiness disruption, and significant liabilities . Security and privacy incidents have le d to, and may continue to lead to, addi tional \nregulatory scrutiny. \nCyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, denial of service attacks, account takeovers, spamming, phishing \nand social engineering attacks could harm our reputation, business, and operating results. \nWe rely heavily on information technology systems across our ope rations. Our information technology systems, including mobile \nand online platforms and mobile payment systems, administrative functions such as human resources, payroll, accounting, and internal \nand external communications, and the information technology system s of our third-party business partners and service providers,  \ncontain proprietary or confidential inform ation related to business and personal data, including se nsitive personal data, entrusted to us \nby platform users, employees, and job candidates, and make us a ta rget for threat actors. Cyberattacks that leverage computer \nmalware, ransomware, viruses, denial of service attacks, account  takeovers, spamming, phishing, and social engineering have bec ome \nmore prevalent, have occurred on our systems in the past, and may occur on our systems in the future. Cyberthreats are constant ly \nevolving and employing more sophisticated attack techniques. Our detection cap abilities may not be suffic ient to prevent or det ect a \nsophisticated cyberattacker. Breach es of our facilities, network, applications, identity management  solutions or data security have in \nthe past and could in the future  disrupt our business or the security of our sy stems and platforms, impair our ability to prote ct data, \ncompromise confidential or technical busin ess information harming our re putation or competitive position, result in theft or mi suse of \nour intellectual property or other assets, subject us to regulator y scrutiny or legal liability, require us to allocate more re sources to \nimprove technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our reputation, busine ss and operating results. In addition, our hybrid and  remote \nworking arrangements may heighten the foregoing risks. \nVarious other factors may also cause syst em failures or security breaches, incl uding power outages, catastrophic events, \ninadequate or ineffective redundancy, issues with upgrading or creating new systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software  or \nservices, intentional acts or errors by our employees or third-pa rty service providers, or breaches  in the security of these sy stems or \nplatforms. For example, fraudsters may attempt to induce employees , contractors, or platform users to disclose information to g ain \naccess to our data or the data of platform users. If our inci dent response, disaster recovery, and business continuity plans do  not \nresolve these issues in an effective manner, they could result  in adverse impacts to our business operations and our financial results. \nBecause of our prominence, the number of platform users, and the types and volume of personal data on our systems, we may be a \nparticularly attractive target for such atta cks. Although we have developed, and continue to develop, systems and processes tha t are \ndesigned to protect our data and that of platform users, and to prevent data loss, undesirable activities on our platform, and security \nbreaches, we cannot guarantee that such measures will provide ab solute security. Our efforts on this front may be unsuccessful as a \nresult of, for example, software bugs or other technical malfunc tions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance; \ngovernment surveillance; or other threats that evolve, and we ma y incur significant costs in pr otecting against or remediating \ncyberattacks. Any actual or perceived failure to maintain the pe rformance, reliability, security, and availability of our produ cts, \nofferings, and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of pl atform users, shareholders and certain regulators would likely  harm our \nreputation and result in loss of revenue from the adverse impact to our reputation and brand, di sruption to our business, and o ur \ndecreased ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers. \nIf we are unable to successfully introduce new or upgraded products, offerings, or features for Drivers, consumers, merchants, \nShippers, and Carriers, we may fail to retain and attract such us ers to our platform and our operating results would be adverse ly \naffected. \nTo continue to retain and attract Drivers, consumers, merchant s, Shippers, and Carriers to our platform, we will need to contin ue \nto invest in the development of new products, offerings, and featur es that add value for Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shipper s, and \nCarriers and that differentiate us from our compe titors. For example, in January 2020, we  introduced a number of product change s in \nCalifornia intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information about rider destinations, trip distance, and expected \nfares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to further strengthe n the \nindependence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform. \nDeveloping and delivering new or upgraded pr oducts, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products, \nofferings, and features depends on several factors, including th e timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of suc h \nproducts, offerings, and features. Moreover, any such new or upgrad ed products, offerings, or features may not work as intended  or \nmay not provide intended value to platform users. For example, some product changes in California have resulted in, and may \ncontinue to result in, reduced demand for rides and reduced suppl y of Drivers on our platform, Dr iver dissatisfaction, and adve rse ",
          " \n24 \nimpacts on the operation of our platform. If we are unable to con tinue to develop new or upgraded products, offerings, and features, or \nif platform users do not perceive value in such new or upgrad ed products, offerings, and features, platform users may choose no t to \nuse our platform, which would adversely affect our operating results. \nWe track certain operational metrics and ou r category position with internal systems an d tools, and our equity stakes in minori ty-\nowned entities with information provided by such minority-owned entities, and do not independently verify such metrics. Certain of \nour operational metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may \nharm our reputation and negatively affect our business. \nWe track certain operational me trics, including key metr ics such as MAPCs, Trips, Gros s Bookings, and our category position, \nwith internal systems and tools, and our equity stakes in minority-own ed entities with information provided by such minority-ow ned \nentities, that are not independently verified by any third part y and which may differ from estimates or similar metrics publish ed by \nthird parties due to differences in source s, methodologies, or the assumptions on which we rely. Our internal systems and tools have a \nnumber of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these me trics may change over time, which could result in unexpected \nchanges to our metrics, including the metr ics we publicly disclose, or our estimate s of our category position. If the internal systems \nand tools we use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors, t he data \nwe report may not be accurate. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for t he \napplicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenge s in measuring how our products are used across large populations  \nglobally. For example, we believe that there are consumers who ha ve multiple accounts, even though we prohibit that in our Term s of \nService and implement measures to detect and prevent that behavior . In addition, limitations or errors with respect to how we m easure \ndata or with respect to the data that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could a ffect our \nlong-term strategies . If our operating metrics or our es timates of our category position or our equity stakes in our minority-o wned \nentities are not accurate representations of our business, or if investors do not perceive our operating metrics or estimates o f our \ncategory position or equity stakes in our minority-owned entities to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to \nthese figures, our reputation may be significantly harmed, and our operating and financial results could be adversely affected. \nIn certain jurisdictions, we allow consumers to pay for rides and meal or grocery deliveries using cash, which raises regulator y, \noperational, and safety concerns. If we do not successfully manage those concerns, we could become subject to adverse regulator y \nactions and suffer reputational harm or other adverse financial and accounting consequences. \nIn certain jurisdictions, including India, Brazil, and Mexico, as  well as certain other countries in Latin America, Europe, the  \nMiddle East, and Africa, we allow consumers to use cash to pay Dr ivers the entire fare of rides and cost of meal deliveries (in cluding \nour service fee from such rides and meal or grocery deliveries) . In 2024, cash-paid trips accounted for approximately 6% of our  global \nGross Bookings. This percentage may increase in the future, partic ularly in the markets in which Careem operates. The number of  \ncountries and product types where cash is accepted is expected to continue to increase. The use of cash in connection with our \ntechnology raises regulatory, operational, and safety concerns. For example, many jurisdictions have specific regulations regar ding the \nuse of cash for ridesharing and certain juri sdictions prohibit the use of cash for ride sharing. Failure to comply with these re gulations \ncould result in the imposition of significa nt fines and penalties and could result in  a regulator requiring that we suspend ope rations in \nthose jurisdictions. In addition to these regulatory concerns, th e use of cash with our Mobility  products and De livery offering can \nincrease safety and security risks for Drivers and riders, incl uding potential robbery, assault, violent or fatal attacks, and other criminal \nacts. In certain jurisdictions such as Brazil, serious safety incidents resulting in robberies and violent, fatal attacks on Dr ivers while \nusing our platform have been reported. If we are not able to ad equately address any of these c oncerns, we could suffer signific ant \nreputational harm, which could adversely impact our business. E xpanding cash payments to additiona l cities or countries could \namplify these risks. \nIn addition, establishing the proper infrastr ucture to ensure that we receive the correct service fee on cash trips is complex,  and \nhas in the past meant and may continue to mean that we cannot collect the entire service fee fo r certain of our cash-based trip s. We \nhave created systems for Drivers to collect and deposit the cash received for cash-based trips a nd deliveries, as well as syste ms for us \nto collect, deposit, and properly account for the cash received, so me of which are not always effective, convenient, or widely- adopted \nby Drivers. Creating, maintaining, and improving these systems requires significant effort and resources, and we cannot guarant ee \nthese systems will be  effective in collecting amounts due to us. Further, operating a business that uses cash raises compliance risks \nwith respect to a variety of rules and regulations, including anti-money laundering laws. If Drivers fail to pay us under the terms of our \nagreements or if our collecti on systems fail, we may be adve rsely affected by both the inability  to collect amounts due and the  cost of \nenforcing the terms of our cont racts, including litigation.  Such collection failure and enfor cement costs, along with any costs  \nassociated with a failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations, could, in the aggregate, impact our financial performance. \nLoss or material modification of our credit  card acceptance privileges could have an adverse effect on our business and operati ng \nresults. \nIn 2024, 62% of our Gross Bookings were paid by either credit card or debit card. As such, the loss of our credit card acceptan ce \nprivileges would significantly limit our business model. We are re quired by our payment processors to comply with payment card \nnetwork operating rules, including the Payment Card Industry (“PCI”) and Data Security Standard (the “Standard”). The Standard is a \ncomprehensive set of requirements for enhancing payment account da ta security developed by the PCI Security Standards Council t o ",
          " \n25 \nhelp facilitate the broad adoption of consis tent data security measures. Our failure to  comply with the Standard and other netw ork \noperating rules could result in fines or re strictions on our ability to accept paymen t cards. Under certain circumstances specified in the \npayment card network rules, we may be required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments , or other assessments of our \ncompliance with the Standard. Such  activities may reveal that we have failed to  comply with the Standa rd. If an audit, self- \nassessment, or other test determines that we need to take steps to remediate any de ficiencies, such remediation efforts may distract our \nmanagement team and require us to undertake costly and time  consuming remediation efforts. In addition, even if we comply with the \nStandard, there is no assurance that we will  be protected from a security breach. Moreover, the payment card networks could ado pt \nnew operating rules or interpret existing rules that we or our pr ocessors might find difficult or even impossible to follow, or  costly to \nimplement. In addition to violations of network rules, including  the Standard, any failure to maintain good relationships with the \npayment card networks could impact our ability to receive incentives from them, could increase our costs, or could otherwise harm our \nbusiness. The loss of our credit card acceptance privileges for any one of these reasons, or th e significant modification of th e terms \nunder which we obtain credit card acceptance privileges, may have an adverse effect on our business, revenue, and operating results. \nOur platform is highly technical, and any undetected errors could adversely affect our business. \nOur platform is a complex system composed of many interope rating components and incorporat es software that is highly \ncomplex. Our business is dependent upon our ability to prevent system interruption on our plat form. Our software, including ope n \nsource software that is incorporated into our code, may now or  in the future contain undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilitie s. Some \nerrors in our software code may only be discovered after the code  has been released. Bugs in our software, third-party software  \nincluding open source software that is incorporated into our code , misconfigurations of our syst ems, and unintended interaction s \nbetween systems could result in our failure to comply with certain federal, st ate, or foreign reporting obligations, or could c ause \ndowntime that would impact the availability of our service to platform users. We have from time to time found defects or errors  in our \nsystem and may discover additional defects in the future that c ould result in platform unavailability or system disruption. In addition, \nwe have experienced outages on our platform due to circumstances within our control, such as outages due to software limitations. We \nrely on co-located data centers for the operation of our platform . If our co-located data centers fail, our platform users may experience \ndown time. If sustained or repeated, any of these outages could reduce the attractiveness of our platform to platform users. In  addition, \nour release of new software in the past has inadvertently caused , and may in the future cause, in terruptions in the availabilit y or \nfunctionality of our platform. A ny errors, bugs, or vulnerabilitie s discovered in our code or systems after release could resul t in an \ninterruption in the availability of our platform or a negative experience for Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, and \ncould also result in negative publicity and unfavorable media covera ge, damage to our reputation, loss of platform users, loss of \nrevenue or liability for damages, regulator y inquiries, or other proceed ings, any of which could a dversely affect our business and \nfinancial results.  \nOur growing use of artificial intelligence an d machine learning may present additional risks, including risks associated with \nalgorithm development or use, the tools and data sets used, and/or a complex, developing regulatory environment. \nOur growing use of artificial intelligence  (“AI”) (including machine learning) in our business and offerings presents additiona l \nrisks. This technology presents a number of risks inherent in its use. AI algorithms or automated decision-making or processing of data \nmay be flawed and datasets may be insufficient or contain ina ccurate or biased information, which can create inaccurate or \ndiscriminatory outcomes. AI tool s and algorithms may use third-party AI with unc lear intellectual prope rty rights or interests.  \nIntellectual property ownership and license  rights, including copyright, of generativ e and other AI output, have not been fully  \ninterpreted by courts or regulations. Europe , the United States and other countries ar e enacting or may consider comprehensive legal \ncompliance frameworks specifically for AI, which is a trend that may increase now that European lawmakers have passed the first  \nsuch framework, the European Artificial In telligence Act (“AI Act”), which came into effect in August 2024. Further, more speci fic \nAI-related laws and regulations have been enacted, and are expected to continue to be enacted, around the world. Any failure or  \nperceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could ha ve an adverse impact on our business. AI use or management by us \nor others, including certain decisions based (whether partially or solely) on automated processi ng or profiling, inappropriate or \ncontroversial data practices, or insufficient disclosures regard ing machine learning and algorithms or AI-generated content, ha ve \nimpaired and could impair the acceptance of AI solutions or subject us to lawsuits, regulatory investigations or other harm, su ch as \nnegative impacts to the value of our intellectual property or our  brand. These and other deficiencies could also undermine the \ndecisions, predictions or analysis AI appl ications produce, or lead to unintentional bias and discriminati on, subjecting us to \ncompetitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm . The rapid evolution of AI ma y require us to allocate additio nal \nresources to help implement AI ethically in order to minimize unintended or harmful impacts, and may also require us to make \nadditional investments in the development of proprietary datasets, machine learning models or other systems, which may be costly.

          " \n26 \nWe are subject to climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, our \nbusiness may be adversely impacted. \nWe face climate change-related physical an d transition risks, which incl ude risks associated with ma rket shifts toward more \nsustainable or renewable forms of energy and energy conservation. In the context of our business, this includes market shifts t oward \nelectric vehicles (“EVs”) and lower carbon business models, and potential increased energy costs. If we fail, or are perceived to fail, to \nkeep up with these market shifts, including changes in consumer preferences and evolving stakehol der expectations, we may lose \ncustomers or face criticism from  the media or our stakeholders , and our business, re putation, financial c ondition and results o f \noperations could be adversely affected. Physical climate change risks include risks related to extreme weather events or natura l \ndisasters, and include extreme storms and temperatures, flooding,  droughts, freezes, wildfires, earthquakes and tsunamis, as we ll as \nchronic changes such as sea-level rise. Climate-related events , including the increasing frequency, severity and duration of ex treme \nweather events and their impact on critical infrastructure in the United States and elsewhere, have the potential to disrupt ou r business, \nour third-party suppliers, and the business of merchants, Shippers , Carriers and Drivers using our platform, and may cause us t o \nexperience higher losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. While we and third parties may take various act ions to \nmitigate business risks associated with climate change, this may require incurri ng substantial costs and may not be successful,  due to, \namong other things, the uncertainty  associated with the longer-term projections associated with managi ng climate risks. Additionally, \nwe are or may become subject to emerging environmental and social laws and regulations, including climate policies such as \nCalifornia’s climate-related disclosure legislation (SB 219) a nd regulations adopted in California in May 2021 requiring 90% of  \nvehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to have  been in zero emission vehicles by 2030, with interim targets b eginning \nin 2023. Certain jurisdictions have also de veloped and implemented rules to address th e environmental impact of rideshare, and \nadditional jurisdictions may consider simila r rules and regulations. We are also subjec t to the Corporate Sustainability Report ing \nDirective, which was adopted in the European Union in December 2022. In addition, Drivers may be subject to climate-related \npolicies that indirectly impact our business, such as the Conge stion Charge Zone and Ultra Low Emission Zone schemes adopted in  \nLondon that impose fees on drivers in fossil-fueled vehicles, wh ich may impact our ability to attract and maintain Drivers on o ur \nplatform, and to the extent we experience Driver supply constraints in a given market, we may need to increase Driver incentives.  \nAdditional regulations may require us to incur significant add itional costs to comply, includi ng increased costs related to \nreporting, the implementation of extensive internal controls proc esses and procedures regarding matters that have not been subj ect to \nsuch levels of controls in the past, and impose increased oversi ght obligations on our management and board of directors, as we ll as \nrequire us to hire third party experts. Additional regulatory requirements may also end up expos ing us to increased activism, l itigation \nand enforcement. All of these risks may also impact our supplie rs, business partners or customers, which may impact our busines s, \nfinancial condition, or results of operations. \nIncreased attention to, and evolving expectations regarding sust ainability matters may adversely  impact our business, reputatio n \nand liabilities, including in the context of certain goals we have announced. \nCompanies across all industries and around the globe are facing in creasing scrutiny relating to their environmental and social \ninitiatives and activities by investors, lenders, regulators, customers, employees and other stakeholders. We have taken, and m ay \ncontinue to take, certain environmental and social actions, in cluding the establishment of environmental and social goals, incl uding \nthose that relate to climate change matters. The increased focus on environmental and social initiatives and evolving stakehold er \nexpectations may present operational, regulat ory, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks and impacts, which could have  an \nadverse impact on our business, including on our reputation and stoc k price. For example, investors and lenders may reconsider their \ncapital investment allocation as a result of their assessment of  our environmental and social practices, which may impact our a ccess to \ncapital. \nOur ability to meet our environmental and social goals is depende nt on many external factors, including such factors as rapidly  \nchanging regulatory developments, government al or political shifts, policies and rela ted interpretation, action from policymake rs and \nthe wider auto industry, advances in technology such as battery st orage, industry-wide investment, as well as the availability, cost and \naccessibility of EVs to Drivers, and the av ailability of critical EV charging infrastru cture that can be efficiently accessed b y Drivers; \nprogress has been made, but without more a ggressive action, we cannot achieve all of our goals. All of our climate change-relat ed \ngoals are intentionally challenging, and are therefore subject to  risks, uncertainties, third pa rty information or action, and conditions, \nmany of which are outside of our control. Progressing towards our climate goals requires us to invest significant effort, resources, and \nmanagement time, and circumstances may arise, including those beyond our control, that may require us to revise our timelines and/or \nclimate goals. For example, when we set our 2025 climate goals, we  anticipated that strong regulatory measures, alongside susta ined \nindustry-wide investment , would support our efforts. While progress has been made, without more aggressive action from \npolicymakers and the wider auto industry, we may not be able to achieve all of our 2025 goals as originally anticipated. There can be \nno assurances that our goals will be achieve d in the manner we currently intend or at all, and any failure or perceived failure to meet \nregulatory requirements related to climate change, or to meet our stated climate change goals (or other environmental and social goals) \non the timeframe we announced, or at all, could have an adverse impact on our cost s and ability to operate, result in litigation, as well \nas harm our brand, reputation, and consequently, our business. \nIn addition, our climate goals are also subject to certain as sumptions, estimations, methodologies, and third-party information that \nwe believed to be reasonable at the time, but which may subsequently be determined to be erroneous, insufficient, incomplete, ",
          " \n27 \ninaccurate or otherwise misaligned with stakeholder expectations . Any failure or perceived fail ure to satisfy evolving stakehol der \nexpectations regarding our climate goals and environmental and social reporting may harm our re putation and impact relationship s \nwith certain investors and other stakeholders. \nFurthermore, there are efforts by some stakeholders to reduce or limit companies’ efforts on certain environmental, social and \ngovernance related matters. Both advocates and opponents are increa singly resorting to a range of activism forms, including med ia \ncampaigns, reputational harm, investigations and litigation, to advance their perspectiv es. To the extent we are subject to suc h \nactivism, and we have been in the past, it may require us to in cur costs or otherwise adversely impact our business. This and o ther \nstakeholder expectations will likely lead to increased compliance costs as well as scrutiny that could heighten all of the risk s identified \nabove and other similar risks. In addition, negative perception of our environmental and social  related initiatives, whether du e to \nperceived over- or under-pursuit of  such initiatives, may result in  issues hiring or retaining em ployees, as well as potential \ninvestigations, regulatory scrutiny, litigation or other adverse impacts to our business. \nGeneral Economic Risks \nOccurrence of a catastrophic event, including but not limited to disease, a weather event, war, or terrorist attack, could adve rsely \nimpact our business, financial condition and results of operation. \nOutbreaks of contagious disease and the impact of actions to mi tigate such disease or pandemic, have adversely impacted and \ncould in the future adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also face risks related to  health \nepidemics, outbreaks of contagious disease, and other adverse health developments. For example, the pandemic and responses ther eto \nhad an adverse impact on our business a nd operations, including, for example, by re ducing the demand for our Mobility offerings  \nglobally, and affecting travel beha vior and demand, as well as impacting Driver supply constraints. As another example, during the \npandemic, to support social distancing, we temporarily suspended our shared rides offering globally.\n \nWe cannot predict the impact a catastrophic event, including dis ease, weather event, war or terrorist attack will have on our \nbusiness, end-users’ behaviors, business partners and third-party vendors, and we may be  adversely impacted as a result of the adverse \nimpact our business partners and third-part y vendors suffer. For example, concerns over the economic impact of the pandemic cau sed \nextreme volatility in financial markets, which adversely impacted our stock price and our ability to access capital markets, an d any \nfuture pandemics or other catast rophic events may have a similar impact. In addition, the broader consequences of conflicts in the \nMiddle East and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which ma y include additional international sanctions, embargoes, regio nal \ninstability, and geopolitical shifts, increase d tensions between the Unite d States and countries in which we operate, and the e xtent of \nthe conflict’s effect on the global economy, cannot be predicted. Any of these risks could materially affect our business or th e value of \nour assets, which could have an adverse effect on our business,  financial condition, operating re sults, or the trading price of  our \ncommon stock. The failure of a bank, or ot her adverse conditions impacting financial in stitutions at which we maintain balances , \ncould adversely impact our liquidity and financial performance. Th ere can be no assurance that our deposits in excess of the Fe deral \nDeposit Insurance Corporation limits will be backstopped by the Un ited States, or that any bank or financial institution with w hich we \ndo business will be able to obtain needed liquidity from other banks, government institutions or by acquisition in the event of  a failure \nor liquidity crisis. To the extent any of the foregoing or ot her catastrophic event adversely affects our business and financia l results, it \nmay also have the effect of heightening ma ny of the other risks described in this “R isk Factors” section. Any of the foregoing factors, \nor other cascading effects that are not foreseeable, could advers ely impact our business, financial performance and condition, and \nresults of operations. \nThe impact of economic conditions, including the resulting effect on discretiona ry consumer spending, may harm our business \nand operating results. \nOur performance is subject to economic conditi ons and their impact on leve ls of discretionary  consumer spendi ng. Some of the \nfactors that have an impact on discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, \nreductions in net worth, residential real es tate and mortgage markets, taxation, energy prices, interest rates, consumer confid ence, \ntariffs, and other macroeconomic factors. A deterioration of general macroeconomic conditi ons, including slower growth or recession, \ninflation and higher interest rates, changes in labor market dynamics, or decreases in consumer spending power may harm our res ults \nof operations. For example, inflation has in creased and is expected to increase our insurance costs. Consumer preferences tend to shift \nto lower-cost alternatives during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. In s uch \ncircumstances, consumers may choose to use one of our lower pr ice-point products over a higher Gross Bookings per Trip offering , \nmay choose to forgo our offerings for lower-cost personal vehicl e or public transportation alternatives, or may reduce total mi les \ntraveled as economic activity decreases. Such a shift in consum er behavior may reduce our netw ork liquidity and may harm our \nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results. Likewise, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, includ ing many \nof the merchants in our network, tend to be more adversely af fected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. Further,  \nbecause spending for food purchases from merc hants is generally consider ed discretionary, any declin e in consumer spending may \nhave a disproportionate effect on our Deliver y offering. If spending at many of the merc hants in our network declines, or if a \nsignificant number of these merchants go out of business, consumers may be less likely to use our products and offerings, which could \nharm our business and operating results. Alternatively, if economic conditions improve, it could lead to Drivers obtaining additional or \nalternative opportunities fo r work, which could negatively im pact the number of Drivers on our  platform, and thereby reduce our  ",
          " \n28 \nnetwork liquidity. \nIncreases in fuel, food, labor, energy, and other costs due to inflation and other factors could adversely affect our operating results. \nFactors such as inflation, increased fuel prices, and increased vehicle purchase, rental, insurance, or maintenance costs, incl uding \nincreased prices of new and used vehicle pa rts as a result of recent global supply ch ain challenges, and increased fuel prices as result \nof the conflict between Russia and Ukraine a nd the conflict in the Middle East, have and may continue to increase the costs inc urred \nby Drivers and Carriers when providing services on our platform. Similarly, factors such as infl ation, increased food costs, in creased \nlabor and employee benefit costs, increased rental costs, and increased energy costs may increase merchant operating costs, \nparticularly in certain internat ional markets, such as Egypt. Many of the factor s affecting Driver, merchant, and Carrier costs  are \nbeyond the control of these parties. In many cases, these increase d costs may cause Drivers and Carriers to spend less time pro viding \nservices on our platform or to seek alternative sources of income. Likewise, these increased costs may cause merchants to pass costs \non to consumers by increasing prices, which would likely cause or der volume to decline, may cause merchants to cease operations  \naltogether, or may cause Carriers to pass costs on to Shippers, which may cause shipments on our platform to decline. A decreas ed \nsupply of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, or Carriers  on our platform would decrease our network liquidity, which coul d \nharm our business and operating results. \nDependencies on Third Parties \nThe successful operation of our business depends upon the performance and reliability of  Internet, mobile, and other \ninfrastructures that are not under our control. \nOur business depends on the performance and re liability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under our \ncontrol. Disruptions in Internet infrastructure or GPS signals or the failure of telecommunicati ons network operators to provid e us \nwith the bandwidth we need to provide our products and offerings have interfered, and could continue to interfere with the spee d and \navailability of our platform. If our platfo rm is unavailable when platform users atte mpt to access it, or if our platform does not load as \nquickly as platform users expect, platform users may not return to  our platform as often in the future, or at all, and may use our \ncompetitors’ products or offerings more often. In  addition, we have no control over the costs of the services provided by natio nal \ntelecommunications operators. If mobile Internet access fees or other charges to Internet users increase, consumer traffic may \ndecrease, which may in turn cause our revenue to significantly decrease. \nOur business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operati on of mobile communications systems. The occurrence of an \nunanticipated problem, such as a power outage, telecommunications delay or failure, security breach, or computer virus could re sult in \ndelays or interruptions to our products, of ferings, and platform, as well as business interruptions for us and platform users. \nFurthermore, foreign governments may leverage their ability to shut down directed services, and local governments may shut down  \nour platform at the routing level. Any of these events could damage our reputation, significantly disrupt our operations, and s ubject us \nto liability, which could adversely affect our business, financ ial condition, and operating result s. We have invested significa nt \nresources to develop new products to mitigate the impact of potential interruptions to mobile communications systems, which can  be \nused by consumers in territories  where mobile communications sy stems are less efficient. However, these products may ultimately  be \nunsuccessful. \nWe rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in certain  of \nour products and offerings. If such third parties interfere with  the distribution of our products or offerings or with our use of such \nsoftware, our business would be adversely affected. \nOur platform relies on third parties maintaining open marketpl aces, including the Apple App Store and Google Play, which make \napplications available for download. We cannot assure you that the marketplaces through which we  distribute our platform will \nmaintain their current structures or that such marketplaces will not charge us fe es to list our applications for download. For example, \nApple Inc. requires that iOS apps obtain users’ permission to track their activities across third-party apps and websites. If i OS users do \nnot grant us such permission, our ability to  target those users for advertisements a nd to measure the effectiveness of such \nadvertisements may be adversely affected, which could decrease the effectiveness of our advertising, and increase our costs to acquire \nand engage users on our platform. We rely upon certain third par ties to provide software for our products and offerings, includ ing \nGoogle Maps for the mapping function that is critical to the func tionality of our platform. We do not believe that an alternati ve \nmapping solution exists that can provide the global functionality that we require to offer our platform in all of the markets in which we \noperate. We do not control all mapping functions employed by our pl atform or Drivers using our platform, and it is possible tha t such \nmapping functions may not be reliable. If such third parties cease to provide access to the third-party software that we and Dr ivers use, \ndo not provide access to such software on terms that we believe to  be attractive or reasonable, or do not provide us with the m ost \ncurrent version of such software, we may be required to seek comp arable software from other sources, which may be more expensiv e \nor inferior, or may not be available at all, any of which would adversely affect our business. \nOur business depends upon the interoperability of our platform  across devices, operating systems, and third-party applications that \nwe do not control. \nOne of the most important features of our platform is its br oad interoperability with a range of devices, operating systems, an d \nthird-party applications. Our platform is accessible from th e web and from devices running various operating systems such as iO S and ",
          " \n29 \nAndroid. We depend on the accessibility of our platform across these third-party operating systems and applications that we do not \ncontrol. Moreover, third-party services and products are constantly  evolving, and we may not be able to modify our platform to assure \nits compatibility with that of other third parties following development changes.  The loss of interoperability, whether due to actions of \nthird parties or otherwise, could adversely affect our business. \nWe rely on third parties for elements of the payment processing  infrastructure underlying our platform. If these third-party \nelements become unavailable or unavailable on favorable terms, our business could be adversely affected. \nThe convenient payment mechanisms provided by our platform are key factors contributing to the development of our business. \nWe rely on third parties for elements of our payment-processing infrastructure to comp lete consumer transactions and remit paym ents \nto Drivers, merchants, and Carriers using our platform, and thes e third parties may refuse to re new our agreements with them on  \ncommercially reasonable terms or at all. If these companies beco me unwilling or unable to provide these services to us on accep table \nterms or at all, our business may be disrupted. For certain paym ent methods, including credit and debit cards, we generally pay  \ninterchange fees and other processing and gateway fees, and such fees result in significant costs. In addition, online payment providers \nare under continued pressure to pay increased fees to banks to process funds, and there is no assurance that such online paymen t \nproviders will not pass any increased costs on to merchant part ners, including us. If these fees increase over time, our operat ing costs \nwill increase, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. \nIn addition, system failures have at times prevented us from making payments to Drivers in accordance with our typical timeline s \nand processes, and have caused substantial Driver dissatisfacti on and generated a significant number of Driver complaints. Futu re \nfailures of the payment processing infrastru cture underlying our platform could cause Drivers to lose trust in our payment oper ations \nand could cause them to instead use our competitors’ platforms. If the quality or convenience of our payment processing infrastructure \ndeclines as a result of these limitations or for any other reason,  the attractiveness of our business to Drivers, merchants, an d Carriers \ncould be adversely affected. If we are forced to migrate to ot her third-party payment service providers for any reason, the tra nsition \nwould require significant time and management resources, and may not be as effective, efficient, or well-received by platform users. \nWe currently rely on a small number of third-party service pr oviders to host a significant portion of our platform, and any \ninterruptions or delays in services from these third parties co uld impair the delivery of our pr oducts and offerings and harm o ur \nbusiness. \nWe use a combination of third-party cloud computing services and co-located data centers in the United States and abroad. We do  \nnot control the physical operation of  any of the co-located data centers we use or the operations of our  third-party service pr oviders. \nThese third-party operations and co-located data centers may expe rience break-ins, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks,  \nsabotage, acts of vandalism, and other misconduct. These faciliti es may also be vulnerable to damage or interruption from power  loss, \ntelecommunications failures, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes , tornadoes, and similar events. Our systems do not provide \ncomplete redundancy of data storage or processing, and as a resu lt, the occurrence of any such event, a decision by our third-p arty \nservice providers to close our co-located data centers without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems may result in o ur \ninability to serve data reliably  or require us to migrate our data to either a new on-premise data center or cloud computing se rvice. \nThis could be time consuming and costly and may result in the loss of data, any of which coul d significantly interrupt the provision of \nour products and offerings and harm our reput ation and brand. We may not be able to easily switch to another cloud or data cent er \nprovider in the event of any disruptions or interference to the se rvices we use, and even if we do, other cloud and data center  providers \nare subject to the same risks. Additionally, our co-located data  center facility agreements are of limited durations, and our c o-located \ndata center facilities have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we a re unable \nto renew our agreements with these facilities on commercially re asonable terms, we may experience delays in the provision of ou r \nproducts and offerings until an agreement with another co-located data center is arranged. Interruptions in the delivery of our products \nand offerings may reduce our revenue, cause Drivers, merchants, and Carriers to stop offering their services through our platfo rm, and \nreduce use of our platform by consumers and Shippers. Our busin ess and operating results may be harmed if current and potential  \nDrivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers believe our platform is unreliable. In addition, if we are unable to scale our data \nstorage and computational capacity sufficie ntly or on commercially r easonable terms, our ability to  innovate and introduce new \nproducts on our platform may be delayed or compromised, which would have an adverse effect on our growth and business. \nOur use of third-party open source software could adversely affect our ability to offer our products and offerings and subjects us to \npossible litigation. ",
          " \n30 \nWe use third-party open source software in  connection with the development of our pl atform. From time to time, companies that \nuse third-party open source software have fa ced claims challenging the use of such ope n source software and their compliance wi th \nthe terms of the applicable open source license. We may be subject  to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to  be \nopen source software, or claiming non-compliance with the applicable open source licensing terms. Some open source licenses req uire \nend-users who distribute or make available across a network software and services that include open source software to make \navailable all or part of such software, which in some circum stances could include valuable proprietary code. While we employ \npractices designed to monitor our complia nce with the licenses of third-party open source software and protect our valuable \nproprietary source code, we have not run a complete open source license review and may inadvertently use third-party open sourc e \nsoftware in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-complianc e with the applicable terms of such license, including claims fo r \ninfringement of intellectual property rights or for breach of contract. Furthermore, there is an increasing number of open-sour ce \nsoftware license types, almost none of which have been tested in  a court of law, resulting in a dearth of guidance regarding th e proper \nlegal interpretation of such licenses. If we  were to receive a claim of non-compliance with the terms of any of our open source  \nlicenses, we may be required to publicly release certain portions  of our proprietary source code or expend substantial time and  \nresources to re-engineer some or all of our software. \nIn addition, the use of third-party open source software typically exposes us to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial \nsoftware because open-source licensors generally do not provide wa rranties or controls on the func tionality or origin of the so ftware. \nUse of open source software may also presen t additional security risks because the public availabi lity of such software may mak e it \neasier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to compromise our platform. Additionally, because any software sour ce \ncode that we make available under an open source license or th at we contribute to existing ope n source projects becomes publicl y \navailable, our ability to protect our intell ectual property rights in such software s ource code may be limited or lost entirely , and we \nwould be unable to prevent our competitors or others from using such contributed software source code. Any of the foregoing could be \nharmful to our business, financial condition, or operating result s and could help our competitor s develop products and offering s that \nare similar to or better than ours. \nFinancing and Transactional Risks \nWe will require additional c apital to support the growth of ou r business, and this capital migh t not be available on reasonable  \nterms or at all. \nTo continue to effectively compete, we w ill require additional funds to support the gr owth of our business and allow us to inve st \nin new products, offerings, and mark ets. If we raise additional f unds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, \nour existing stockholders may suffer signifi cant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue may have rights, preferences,  and \nprivileges superior to those of existing st ockholders. Certain of our exis ting debt instruments contai n, and any debt financing  we \nsecure in the future could contain, restrictive covenants rela ting to our ability to incur additional indebtedness and other fi\nnancial and \noperational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtai n additional capital with whic h to pursue business opportunities . For \nexample, our existing debt instruments cont ain significant restrictions on our ability  to incur additional secured indebtedness . We may \nnot be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if  at all. If we are unable to obt ain adequate financing or fina ncing on \nterms satisfactory to us when required, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business chall enges \nand competition may be significantly limited. \nWe have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in th e future incur additional indebted ness. Our payment obligations \nunder such indebtedness may limit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility in \noperating our business. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we had total outstanding inde btedness of $9.6 billion aggregate pr incipal amount. In addition, up to \napproximately $128 million of  Careem Convertible Notes remain  subject to future issuance to Careem stockholders as of \nDecember 31, 2024. Subject to the limitations in the terms of our  existing and future indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may  incur \nadditional debt, secure existing or future de bt, or refinance our debt. In particular, we may need to incur additional debt to finance the \npurchase of autonomous vehicles, and such financing may not be available to us on attractive terms or at all. \nWe may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations  to pay interest and principal on our \nindebtedness. Such payments will reduce the funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporat e \npurposes and limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans, and o ther \ninvestments, which may in turn limit our ability to implement our business strategy, heighten our vulnerability to downturns in  our \nbusiness, the industry, or in the general economy, limit our flex ibility in planning for, or r eacting to, changes in our busine ss and the \nindustry, and prevent us from ta king advantage of busines s opportunities as they arise. We ca nnot assure you that our business will \ngenerate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future financing will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make \nrequired and timely payments on our indebtedness, or to fund our operations. To date, we have used a substantial amount of cash  for \noperating activities, and we cannot assure you when we will begin to generate cash from operating activities in amounts suffici ent to \ncover our debt service obligations. \nIn addition, under certain of our existing debt instruments, we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to limitations rega rding \nour business and operations, including limitations on incurring add itional indebtedness and liens, limitations on certain consolidations, ",
          " \n31 \nmergers, and sales of assets, and restrictions on the payment of  dividends or distributions. Any debt financing secured by us i n the \nfuture could involve add itional restrictive covenants relati ng to our capital-raising activitie s and other financial and operat ional \nmatters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital to pursue busin ess opportunities, including poten tial \nacquisitions or divestitures. Any default under our debt arrangeme nts could require that we repay our loans immediately, and ma y \nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing, which in turn may have an adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity. \nIn addition, we are exposed to interest rate risk related to some of our indebtedness, which is discussed in greater detail und er the \nsection titled “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Quantitative and Qualitative \nDisclosures About Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk.” \nWe may have exposure to materially greater than anticipated tax liabilities. \nThe tax laws applicable to our global business activities are subj ect to uncertainty and can be interpreted differently by diff erent \ncompanies. For example, we may become subject to sales tax rates in certain jurisdictions that are significantly greater than t he rates \nwe currently pay in those jurisd ictions. Like many other multinati onal corporations, we are subjec t to tax in multiple U.S. and  foreign \njurisdictions and have structured our operations to reduce our effective tax rate. Currently, certain jurisdictions are investi gating our \ncompliance with tax rules. If it is determined that we are not compliant with such rules, we could owe additional taxes. \nCertain jurisdictions, including Australia, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the UK and other countries, require that we pay any assessed \ntaxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the appli cability of tax assessments in those jurisdictions. These amounts could \nmaterially adversely impact our liquidity while those matters are being litigated. This prepayment of contested taxes is referr ed to as \n“pay-to-play.” Payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes; even when such paymen ts \nare made, we continue to defend our positions vigorously. If we prevail in the proceedings for which a pay-to-play payment was made, \nthe jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest. \nAdditionally, the taxing authorities of the ju risdictions in which we operate have in the past, and may in the future, examine or \nchallenge our methodologies for valuing deve loped technology, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm ou r \nfinancial position and operating results. Furthermore, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lo wer \nthan anticipated in ju risdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and hi gher than anticipated in ju risdictions that have hi gher \nstatutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance on our U. S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, or changes in tax law s, \nregulations, or accounting principles. We are subject to regular review and audit by both U.S. federal and state tax authoritie s, as well \nas foreign tax authorities, and currently face numerous audits in the United States and abroad. Any adverse outcome of such rev iews \nand audits could have an adverse effect on our financial position and operating results. In addition, the determination of our worldwide \nprovision for income taxes and other tax lia bilities requires significant judgment by our mana gement, and we ha ve engaged in ma ny \ntransactions for which the ultimate tax de termination remains uncertain. The ultimat e tax outcome may differ from the amounts \nrecorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such \ndetermination is made. Our tax positions or tax returns are subject  to change, and therefore we cannot accurately predict wheth er we \nmay incur material additional tax liabilities in the future, whic h could impact our financial position. In addition, in connect ion with \nany planned or future acquisitions, we may acquire businesses that  have differing licenses and other arrangements that may be \nchallenged by tax authorities for not being at  arm’s-length or that are otherwise potentially less tax efficient than our licen ses and \narrangements. Any subsequent integration or continued operation of such acquired businesses may result in an increased effectiv e tax \nrate in certain jurisdictions or potential indirect tax costs,  which could result in us incurring additional tax liabilities or  having to \nestablish a reserve in our consolidated financial statements, and could adversely affect our financial results. \nChanges in global and U.S. tax legislation may adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. \nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in mu ltiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisd ictions. We are unable to predict \nwhat other global or U.S. tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in  the future or what effects such future changes would have o n our \nbusiness. Any such changes in tax legislation, regulations, polic ies or practices in the jurisdictions in which we operate coul d increase \nthe estimated tax liability that we have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheet; affect our financial positi on, future \noperating results, cash flows, and effective tax rates where we  have operations; reduce post-tax returns to our stockholders; a nd \nincrease the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance. We could become subject to new or additional digital services taxe s in \none or more jurisdictions where we operate . The governments of countries in which we  operate and other governmental bodies coul d \nmake unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined in th eir jurisdictions that are cont rary to the way in which we have \ninterpreted and historically applied the rules and regulations de scribed above in our income tax returns filed in such jurisdictions. New \nlaws could significantly increase our tax obligations in the count ries in which we do business or require us to change the mann er in \nwhich we operate our business. As a result of the large and e xpanding scale of our international business activities, many of t hese \nchanges to the taxation of our activities could increase our wo rldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position, oper ating \nresults, and cash flows. \nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we had U.S. fede ral net operating loss carryforwards of $176 m illion that begin to expire in 2031 and \n$8.2 billion that have an unlimite d carryover period. As of Decemb er 31, 2024, we had U.S. stat e net operating loss carryforwar ds of ",
          " \n32 \n$7.5 billion that started expiring in 2024 and $1.6 billion that have an unlimite d carryover period. As of  December 31, 2024, w e had \nforeign net operating loss carry forwards of $759 million that st arted expiring in 2024  and $19.2 billion that have an unlimited  \ncarryover period. Realization of these net op erating loss carryforwards depends on our future taxable income, and there is a ri sk that \nour existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to  offset future income tax li abilities, which could material ly and \nadversely affect our operating results. In addition, under Secti ons 382 and 383 of the IRC, if a corporation undergoes an “owne rship \nchange,” generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by valu e) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corpor ation’s \nability to use its pre-ownership change U.S. federal net operati ng loss carryforwards and other pr e-ownership change U.S. feder al tax \nattributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-ow nership change income may be limited. Many U.S. states follow si milar \nrules for restricting use of tax attributes after an ownership ch ange. We may experience ownership changes in the future becaus e of \nsubsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-ownership chan ge net \noperating loss carryforwards and other tax attr ibutes to offset U.S. federal and state taxable income may be subject to limitat ions, \nwhich could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. \nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. \nBecause we conduct a significant and may co nduct a growing portion of our business in currencies othe r than the U.S. dollar but  \nreport our consolidated financial results in U.S. dollars, we face  exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As exch ange \nrates vary, revenue, cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, operating expenses, other income and expense,  and \nassets and liabilities, when translated, may also vary materia lly and thus affect our overall financial results. Although we ha ve entered \ninto and may in the future, enter into hedging arrangements to ma nage foreign currency translati on, such activity may not compl etely \neliminate fluctuations in our operating resu lts due to currency exchange rate changes. Hedging arrangements are inherently risk y, and \nwe have limited experien ce establishing hedgi ng programs, which could expos e us to additional risks th at could adversely affect  our \nfinancial condition and operating results. \nIf we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrat e suitable businesses, our operati ng results and prospects could  be \nharmed, and any businesses we acquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated. \nAs part of our business strategy, we have entered into, and expect  to continue to enter into, ag reements to acquire companies, \nform joint ventures, divest portions or aspects of our business,  sell minority stakes in portions or aspects of our business, a nd acquire \ncomplementary companies or technologies. Competition within our industry for acquisitions of businesses, technologies, and assets is \nintense. As such, even if we are able to identify a target fo r acquisition, we may not be able to complete the acquisition on \ncommercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to receive a pproval from the applicable comp etition authorities, or such targ et \nmay be acquired by another company, including one of our competitors.  \nFurther, negotiations for potentia l acquisitions or other transactions may result in the diversion of our management’s time and  \nsignificant out-of-pocket costs. We may expend significant cash or incur substantial debt to finance such acquisitions, and suc h \nindebtedness may restrict our business or require the use of available cash to  make interest and principal payments. In additio n, we \nmay finance or otherwise complete acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities , which may result in dilution t o our \nstockholders, or if such convertible debt securities are not converted, significant cash outlays. If we fail to evaluate and ex ecute \nacquisitions or other strategic transactions successfully or fail  to successfully address any of these risks, our business, fin ancial \ncondition, and operating results may be harmed. \nIn addition, any businesses we acquire may not perform as well as we expect. Failure to mana ge and successfully integrate \nacquired businesses and technologies, including managing internal cont rols and any privacy, data security or AI risks associate d with \nsuch acquisitions, may harm our ope rating results and expans ion prospects. For example, Careem  has historically shared certain user \ndata with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We have \nmaintained our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem’s business, and doing so may cause o ur \nrelationships with government authorities in  certain jurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such government authorities ass essing \nfines or penalties against us. The proces s of integrating an acquired company, bus iness, or technology or acquired personnel in to our \ncompany is subject to various risks and challenges, including: \n• diverting management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration; \n• disrupting our ongoing business operations; \n• platform user acceptance of the acquired company’s offerings; \n• implementing or remediating the controls, procedures, and policies of the acquired company; \n• integrating the acquired business onto our systems and en suring the acquired business meets our financial reporting \nrequirements and timelines; \n• retaining and integrating acquired em ployees, including aligning incentives be tween acquired employees and existing \nemployees, managing cultural differences between acquired businesses and our business, as well as managing costs \nassociated with eliminating redundancies or transferring employees on acceptable terms with minimal business disruption; ",
          " \n33 \n• maintaining important business relationships and contracts of the acquired business; \n• integrating the brand identity of an acquired company with our own; \n• integrating companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience; \n• liability for pre-acquisition activities of the acquired company; \n• litigation or other claims or liabilities arising in connection with the acquisition or the acquired company; and \n• impairment charges associated with goodwill, long-lived assets, investments, and other acquired intangible assets. \nWe have in the past and may in the futu re implement integration structures that do not fully integrate an acquired company’s \noperating functions. Such structures may delay the efficiencies that we expect to gain from the acquisition and our brand and \nreputation could be impacted by any damage or reputational harm to the acquired company’s brand. \nIn addition, our acquisition of Careem has increased our risks under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other \nsimilar laws outside the United States. Our existing and pl anned safeguards, including training and compliance programs to \ndiscourage corrupt practices by such partie s, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we coul d be \nheld responsible. \nWe may not receive a favorable return on investment for prior or future business combinations, and we cannot predict whether \nthese transactions will be accretive to th e value of our common stock. It is also possible that acquisitions, combinations, divestitures, \njoint ventures, or other strategic transac tions we announce could be viewed negatively by the press, investors, platform users,  or \nregulators, any or all of which may adversely affect our reputa tion and our business. Any of th ese factors may adversely affect  our \nability to consummate a transaction, our financial condition, and our operating results. \nWe cannot guarantee that our share repurcha se program will be fully consummated or th at it will enhance long-term stockholder \nvalue. \nAlthough our board of directors has authoriz ed a share repurchase program, the program  does not obligate us to repurchase any \nspecific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shar es of our common stock. The timing, manner, price and amount of any \nrepurchases are determined at the discretion of our manageme nt, depending on market conditions and other factors. We cannot \nguarantee that the program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long- term stockholder value, and it may not prove to be \nthe best use of our cash. The program coul d affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility, and any announcement  of a \ntermination of this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stoc k. In addition, this program will reduce o ur cash \nreserves. \nLegal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business \nWe may continue to be blocked from or limited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, an d \nmay be required to modify our business model in those jurisdictions as a result. \nIn certain jurisdictions, including expansion markets such as Arge ntina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, our \nridesharing business model has been blocked, capped, or suspended,  or we have been required to change our business model, due \nprimarily to laws and significant regulatory restrictions in such jurisdictions. In some cases, we have applied for and obtaine d licenses \nor permits to operate and must continue to  comply with the license or permit requireme nts or risk revocation. In addition, we m ay not \nbe able to maintain or renew any such license or permit. We cannot predict whether future regulatory decisions or legislation i n other \njurisdictions may embolden or enc ourage other authorities to take similar actions even where we are operating according to the terms \nof an existing license or permit. \nTraditional taxicab and car service operators in various jurisdic tions in the United States and abroad continue to lobby legisl ators \nand regulators to block our Mobility  products or to require us to  comply with regulatory, insu rance, record-keeping, licensing,  and \nother requirements to which taxicab and car services are subject . For example, in January 2019,  we suspended our Mobility produ cts \nin Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations ma ndating minimum wait times before riders could be picked up by  \nridesharing drivers; in March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via taxis only. In December 2018, Ne w York City’s Taxi and Limousine \nCommission implemented a per-mile and per- minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, \nfor drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform. These minimum rate s \ntook effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulat ions have had an adverse impact on our financial performance i n \nNew York City and may continue to do so in the future. In A ugust 2018, the New York City Council voted to approve various \nmeasures to further regulate our business, including driver earning rules, licensing requirements, and a one-year freeze on new for-hire \nvehicle licenses for ridesharing services like those enabled vi a our platform; the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains.  \nAdditionally, in November 2019, a ballot measure to impose a su rcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by vote rs in \nSan Francisco and such surcharge took effect on January 1, 2020. Also in January 2020, a new tax went into effect in Chicago th at \nimposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing trip taken in Chicago. In addition, in March 2022, a Washington state bill was signed \ninto law establishing a minimum pay standard  for drivers providing servi ces on our platform, and othe r jurisdictions have in th e past \nconsidered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for ",
          " \n34 \nminimum wages while providing serv ices on our platform. Similar legislative or regulatory initiatives are being considered or h ave \nbeen enacted in countries outside the United States. If other jurisdictions impose similar regul ations, our business growth cou ld be \nadversely affected. \nIn certain jurisdictions, we are subject to  national, state, local, or municipal laws  and regulations that are ambiguous in the ir \napplication or enforcement or that we believe are invalid or in applicable. In such jurisdictions , we may be subject to regulato ry fines \nand proceedings and, in certain cases, may be required to cease operations altogether if we continue to operate our business as  \ncurrently conducted, unless and until such laws and regulations are reformed to clarify that our business operations are fully compliant \nor such laws and regulations are determined  to be invalid or inapplicable. For exam ple, in September 2020, the Hong Kong Court of \nFinal Appeal issued a ruling against a group of drivers who used th e Uber app, concluding that by driving for hire without a Hi re Car \nPermit, they violated the local Road Traffic Ordinance. A judici al review process is pending. Ho wever, these developments may \nadversely affect our ability to offer ridesharing services and negatively impact our financial performance in Hong Kong. As ano ther \nexample, in January 2020, we ceased offering  our Mobility products in Colombia after a Colombian court ruled that we violated local \ncompetition laws. In response, we appealed the decision, made  certain changes to our Mobility products in Colombia and re-launched \nMobility in Colombia in Februa ry 2020, and in June 2020, the Appeals Court of Bogota revoked its order to  block Mobility produc ts \nin Colombia. Such decision was confirmed by the Colombia Supreme Court in 2023. Furthermore, in certain of these jurisdictions,  we \ncontinue to provide our products and offerings while we assess the applicability of these laws and regulations to our products and \nofferings or while we seek judicial, regulat ory or policy changes to address concerns w ith respect to our ab ility to comply wit h these \nlaws and regulations. Our decision to continue operating in thes e instances has come under investigation or has otherwise been subject \nto scrutiny by government authorities. Our c ontinuation of this practice and other past  practices may result in fines or other penalties \nagainst us and Drivers imposed by local re gulators, potentially increasing the risk that our licenses or permits that are neces sary to \noperate in such jurisdictions will not be re newed. Such fines and penalties have in th e past been, and may in the future continue to be, \nimposed solely on Drivers, which may cause Drivers to stop provi ding services on our platform. In many instances, we make the \nbusiness decision as a gesture of goodwill to pa y the fines on behalf of Drivers or to pa y Drivers’ defense costs, which, in th e \naggregate, can be in the millions  of dollars. Furthermore, such business practice s may also result in negative press coverage, which \nmay discourage Drivers and consumers from using our platform and could adversely af fect our revenue. In addition, we face \nregulatory obstacles, includi ng those lobbied for by our compe titors or from local governments gl obally, that have favored and may \ncontinue to favor local or incumbent co mpetitors, including obstacles for potential Drivers seeking to obtain required licenses  or \nvehicle certifications. In addition, an increasing number of m unicipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respec t to our \nDelivery offering and caps on surge pricing with respect to our M obility offering. We have incurred, and expect that we will co ntinue \nto incur, significant costs in defending our right to operate in accordance with our business model in many jurisdictions. To t he extent \nthat efforts to block or limit our operations are successful, or we or Drivers are required to comply with regulatory and other  \nrequirements applicable to taxicab and car services, our revenue and growth would be adversely affected. \nOur business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future \nprospects. \nAs of December 31, 2024, our platform is av ailable in more than 15,000 cities in over 70 countries. We are subject to differing , \nand sometimes conflicting, laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we provide our offerings. A large number of \nproposals are before various national, regional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in \nforeign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model. Certain proposals, if adopted, could significantly and m aterially \nharm our business, financial condition, and operating results by restricting or limiting how we ope rate our business, increasin g our \noperating costs, and decreasing our number of platform users. We cannot predict whether or when such proposals may be adopted. \nFurther, existing or new laws and regulations could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessar y to \ncomply with such laws and regulations, and could dampen the gr owth and usage of our platform. For example, as we expand our \nofferings in new areas, such as  non-emergency medical tran sportation, we may be subject to additional h ealthcare-related federal and \nstate laws and regulations. Additionally, becau se our offerings are frequently first-to -market in the jurisd ictions in which we  operate, \nseveral local jurisdictions have passed, and we expect additional jurisdictions to pass, laws and regulations that limit or blo ck our \nability to offer our products to Drivers and consumers in thos e jurisdictions, thereby impeding overall use of our platform. We  are \nactively challenging some of these laws and regulations and ar e lobbying other jurisdictions to oppose similar restrictions on our \nbusiness, especially our ridesharing services. Further, becaus e a substantial portion of our bus iness involves vehicles that run on fossil \nfuels, laws, regulations, or governmental actions seeking to cu rb air pollution or emissions may impact our business. Moreover,  in \nMay 2021, California adopted a regul ation requiring 90% of vehicle mi les traveled by rideshare fleets in California to have bee n in \nEVs by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. Additionally , proposed ridesharing regulations  in Egypt and other jurisdic tions \nmay require us to share certain personal data with government authorities to operate our app, wh ich we may not be willing to pr ovide. \nOur failure to share such data  in accordance with these regulations may resu lt in government authoritie s assessing significant fines or \npenalties against us or shutting down our or Careem’s app in Egypt on either a temporary or indefinite basis. \nIn addition, we are currently involved in litigation in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We initiated some of these \nlegal challenges to contest the application of certain laws and regulations to our bus iness. Others have been brought by taxica b \nowners, local regulators, local law enforcem ent, and platform users, including Driver s and consumers. These include individual,  ",
          " \n35 \nmultiple plaintiff, and putative class and class action claims for alleged violation of laws related to, among other things, transportation, \ncompetition, advertising, consumer protection, fee calculati ons, personal injuries, privacy, intellectual property, product lia bility, \ndiscrimination, safety, and employment. For example, in May 2019, a class action was filed against us and certain of our subsid iaries \nin the Supreme Court of Victoria, Australia on behalf of partic ipants in the taxi, hire-car, limousine, and charter vehicle ind ustry who \nwere licensed to operate in particular regions of Australia during certain periods between April 2014 and August 2017. The clas s \naction alleges that we operated unlawfully in such regions duri ng such periods. The court approved the class action settlement with no \nadmission of liability by Uber. In September 2024, a constitutiona l reform to the judiciary in Mexico was approved; secondary \nregulations are still pending, which are needed to assess the legal impact on our operations in Mexico. These legislative and regulatory \nproceedings, allegations, and lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could resu lt in \nfinancial damages or penalties, including criminal penalties, in carceration, and sanctions for i ndividuals employed by us or pa rties \nwith whom we contract, which could harm our  ability to operate our business as planned in  one or more of the jurisdictions in w hich \nwe operate, which could adversely affect our business, revenue, and operating results. \nIn addition, while we divested certain assets of our dockless e-bikes and e-scooters business to Lime in May 2020, consumers in  \ncertain cities continue to have access to dockless e-bikes and e-scooters through our app. We expect dockless e-bikes and e-scooters to \nsubject us to additional risks distinct from those relating to  our other Mobility, Delivery and Freight offerings. For example,  \nconsumers using dockless e-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe  level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced w hile \nriding in a vehicle, given the less sophisticated, and in some  cases absent, passive protecti on systems on dockless e-bikes and  e-\nscooters. The occurrence of real or percei ved quality problems or material defects in current or future dockless e-bikes or e-s cooters \navailable via our app could result in negative publicity, market withdrawals, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or l awsuits \nfiled against us, particularly if consumers are injured. \nChanges in, or failure to comply with, co mpetition laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating \nresults. \nCompetition authorities closely sc rutinize us under U.S. and fo reign antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of \ngovernments are enforcing competition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as \nthe EU, the United States, Brazil, and India,  particularly surroundi ng issues of pricing parity, earnings parity, price-fixing, and abuse \nof market power. Many of these jurisdictions  also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. For \nexample, complaints have been filed in several jurisdictions, including in the United States and Germany, alleging that our bus iness \npractices violate applicable an titrust and/or competition laws. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impos e new requirements or \nrestrictions on our business, other jurisdictions may follow. Further, any new requirements or restrictions, or proposed requirements or \nrestrictions, could result in adverse publicity or fines, whether or not valid or subject to appeal. \nIn addition, governmental agencies and regulators have and may in the future, among other things, prohibit acquisitions, \ndivestitures, or combinations we plan to make, impose significan t fines or penalties, require di vestiture of certain of our ass ets, or \nimpose other restrictions that limit or require us to modify our operations, incl uding limitations on our contractual relationships with \nplatform users or restrictions on our pricing models. Such rulings may alter the way in which we do business and, therefore, ma y \ncontinue to increase our costs or liabil ities or reduce demand for our platform, whic h could adversely affect our business, fin ancial \ncondition, or operating results. \nWe expect that antitrust enforcement agencies (including the DOJ and the FTC) will continue to closely scrutinize merger activity, \nwith a particular focus on the technology sector, and there can be  no assurance that proposed, completed or future mergers, \nacquisitions and divestitures will not be the subject of an investigation or  enforcement action by the DOJ, the FTC or another antitrust \nenforcement agency. Changes in antitrust laws globally, or in their interpretation, administration or enforcement, may limit ou r future \nacquisitions, divestitures, operations and growth. \nOur business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial \nservices. \nMost jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. Regulators in certain \njurisdictions may determine that certain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtain licen ses to \ncontinue to operate in such jurisdictions. For example, our subs idiary in the Netherlands, Uber Payments B.V ., is registered an d \nauthorized by its competent authority, De Nederlandsche Bank, as  an electronic money institution.  This authorization permits Ub er \nPayments B.V . to provide payment services (including acquiring and executing payment transactions and money remittances, as \nreferred to in the Revised Payment Services Directive (2015/2366/ EU)) and to issue electronic money in the Netherlands. In addi tion, \nUber Payments B.V . has notified De Nederlandsche Bank that it will provide such services on a cross-border passport basis into other \ncountries within the EEA. Uber Payments UK Limited holds a si milar license in the United Kingdom issued by the Financial Conduc t \nAuthority, as does UBR Pagos México, S.A. de C.V ., Institución de Fondos de Pago Electrónico, issued by the Comisión Nacional \nBancaria y de Valores in Mexico. We continue to critically ev aluate our options for seeking additional licenses and approvals i n \nseveral other jurisdictions to optimize our payment solutions and support the future growth of our business. We could be denied  such \nlicenses, have existing licenses revoked, or be required to make significant changes to our busin ess operations before being gr anted \nsuch licenses. If we are denied payment or other financial licen ses or such licenses are revoked, we could be forced to cease o r limit ",
          " \n36 \nbusiness operations in certain jurisdictions, including in the EEA, and even if we are able to obtain such licenses, we could b e subject \nto fines or other enforcement action, or stripped of such license s, if we are found to violate the requirements of such licenses. In some \ncountries, it is not clear whether we are required to be licensed as a payment services provider. Were local regulators to determine that \nsuch arrangements require us to be so licensed, such regulators ma y block payments to Drivers, merchants, Shippers or Carriers.  Such \nregulatory actions, or the need to obtain regulatory approvals, could impose significant costs and involve substantial delay in payments \nwe make in certain local markets, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results. \nPayments made by platform users with payment instruments or pa yment accounts issued in jurisdictions such as the EEA, the UK \nand Mexico for services provided through our platform may be  subject to Strong Customer Au thentication (“SCA”) regulatory \nrequirements. In many cases, SCA will require a platform user to  engage in additional steps to authenticate each payment transaction. \nThese additional authentication requirements in the EEA, UK and Mexi co or similar requirements, such as tokenization, in other \ncountries may make our platform user expe rience substantially less convenient, and su ch loss of convenience could meaningfully \nreduce the frequency with which platform users use our platform or could cause some platform users to stop using our platform \nentirely, which could adversely affect our business, financial c ondition, operating results, and prospects. Further, as a resul t of \nimplementing SCA, many payment transactions on our platform may fa il to be authenticated due to platform users not completing a ll \nnecessary authentication steps. Thus, in some cases, we may not receive payment from consumers in advance of paying Drivers for  \nservices received by those users. A substantial increase in th e frequency with which we make Driver payments without having \nreceived corresponding payments from consumers could adversely af fect our business, financial condition, operating results, and  \nprospects. \nIn addition, laws related to money transmission and online paymen ts are evolving, and changes in such laws could affect our \nability to provide payment processing on our platform in the same form and on the same terms as we have historically, or at all . For \nexample, changes to our business in Europe, combined with changes to the EU Payment Services Directive, caused aspects of our \npayment operations in the EEA to fall within  the scope of European payments regulation.  As a result, one of our subsidiaries, U ber \nPayments B.V ., is directly subject to fi nancial services regulations (including t hose relating to anti-money laundering, terror ist \nfinancing, and sanctioned or prohibited pers ons) in the Netherlands and in other countries in the EEA where it conducts busines s. \nEffective July 1, 2020, we transitioned a ll our payment operations to the Uber Paymen ts B.V . regulated entity in the EEA countries in \nwhich we are required to do so by the European payments regulations. \nIn addition, as we evolve our business or make changes to our  business structure, we may be subject to additional laws or \nrequirements related to money transmission, online payments, and financial regulation. These laws govern, among other things, money \ntransmission, prepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfers, anti-money laun dering, counter-terrori st financing, banki ng, \nsystemic integrity risk assessments, security of payment proc esses, and import and export re strictions. Our business operations , \nincluding our payments to Drivers and mercha nts, may not always comply with these fi nancial laws and regulations. Historical or  \nfuture non-compliance with these laws or regulations could resu lt in significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties, forfei ture of \nsignificant assets, or other enforcement actions. Costs associated with fines and enforcement actions, as well as reputational harm, \nchanges in compliance requirements, or limits on our ability to expand our product offerings, could harm our business. \nFurther, our payment system is susceptible to illegal and im proper uses, including fraud on our platform such as fraud against \nus \nor platform users, money laundering, terrorist financing, fraudul ent sales of goods or services, and payments to sanctioned par ties. We \nhave invested and will need to continue to invest substantial resources to comply with applicable anti-money laundering and sanctions \nlaws, and in certain jurisdictions, such as the EEA, the UK and Mexico to conduct appropriate risk assessments and implement \nappropriate controls as a regulated financial service provider. Government authorities may seek to bring legal action against u s if our \npayment system is used for improper or illegal purposes or if our enterprise risk management or controls in certain jurisdictio ns such \nas the EEA, the UK, and Mexico are not adequately assessed, update d, or implemented, and any such action could result in financ ial \nor reputational harm to our business. \nWe currently are subject to a number of in quiries, investigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, other federal, st ate \nand local government agencies and other foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business. \nWe are the subject of DOJ inquiries and investigations, as well as enforcement inquiries and investigations by other federal, s tate \nand local government agencies and other regulators abroad. Those inquiries and investigations co ver a broad range of matters, \nincluding but not limited to, our business prac tices, such as fees, driver and courier earnings, consumer pricing, earner benef its, and \nrelated disclosures, policies and practices related to use of our  platform by consumers with disabilities, relationships with third parties, \ndata privacy practices, and data privacy and security incidents. These issues may continue to l ead to costly and time-consuming  \nregulatory investigations and litig ation from other government enti ties, as well as potentially ma terial fines and penalties im posed by \nother U.S. and international regulators. I nvestigations and enforcement actions from such entities, as well as continued negati ve \npublicity and an erosion of current and prospective platform user s’ trust, could severely disrupt our business. In addition, in  March \n2022, Uber Technologies, Inc. and Uber B.V . were each fined €2.12 million by the Italian data protection authority for alleged privacy \nviolations stemming from an investigation conducted in 2018. \nWe are also subject to inquiries and inves tigations by government agencies related to certain transactions we have entered into  in \nthe United States and other countries. ",
          " \n37 \nThese government inquiries and investigations are time-consuming and require a great deal of financial resources and attention \nfrom us and our senior management. If any of  these matters are resolved adversely to us, we may be subject to additional fines,  \npenalties, and other sanctions, and could be forced to change our  business practices substantiall y in the relevant jurisdiction s. Any \nsuch determinations could also result in significant adverse publicity or additional reputational harm, and could result in or complicate \nother inquiries, investigati ons, or lawsuits from other regulators in future me rger control or conduct investigations. Any of t hese \ndevelopments could result in material financial damages or operational restrictions, and harm our business. \nWe face risks related to our colle ction, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investi gations, \ninquiries, litigation, fines, legislative and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices. \nThe nature of our business exposes us to claims, including civil lawsuits in the United States such as those related to the 201 6 \nBreach. These and any past or future privacy or security incidents could result in violation of applicable U.S. and international privacy, \ndata protection, and other laws. Such viol ations subject us to individual or consum er class action litigation as well as govern mental \ninvestigations and proceedings by federal, state, and local regulatory entities in the United States and internationally, resul ting in \nexposure to material civil or cr iminal liability. Ou r data security and privacy  practices have been th e subject of inquiries fr om \ngovernment agencies and regulators, not all of which are finally resolved. In April 2018, we entered into an FTC consent decree  \npursuant to which we agreed, among other things, to implement a comprehensive privacy program , undergo biennial third-party \nassessments, and not misrepresent how we protect consumer info rmation through 2038. In October 2018, the FTC approved the final  \nsettlement, which exposes us to penalties for, amongst other activ ities, future failure to report security incidents. In Novemb er and \nDecember 2018, UK, Dutch and French superv isory authorities imposed fi nes totaling approxi mately $1.6 million. We have also \nentered into settlement agreements with numerous state enforcement agencies. For example, in January 2016, we entered into a \nsettlement with the Office of the New York State Attorney Gene ral under which we agreed to enhance our data security practices.  In \naddition, in September 2018, we entered into stipulated judgments  with the state attorneys general of all 50 U.S. states and th e District \nof Columbia relating to the 2016 Breach, wh ich involved payment of  $148 million and assurances that  we would enhance our data \nsecurity and privacy prac tices. In addition, in March 2022, Uber Technologies, Inc. and Uber B.V . were each fined €2.12 million by \nthe Italian data protection aut hority for alleged privacy viola tions stemming from an investig ation conducted in 2018. Additionally, in \nJuly 2022, we entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the DOJ concerning its investigation into our handling of the 2016 \nBreach. Failure to comply with these and other orders could result in substantial fines, enforcement actions, injunctive relief, and other \npenalties that may be costly or that may impact our business. We may also assume liabilities for breaches experienced by the \ncompanies we acquire as we expand our operations. For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant \nregulatory authorities that it had been subject to a data security  incident that allowed access to certain personal information  of riders \nand drivers on its platform as of January 14,  2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability  as a result of this or other data se curity \nincidents or if we fail to remediate this or any other data secu rity incident that Careem or we experience, we may face harm to  our \nbrand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. If we fail  to remediate any data security incident that we experience,\n we may \nface harm to our brand, business disrup tion, and significant liabilities. Our insurance programs may not cover all potential cl aims to \nwhich we are exposed and may not be adequate to indemnify us for the full extent of our potential liabilities. We may also be impacted \nby privacy or security incidents at third- party service providers. We rely on third-pa rty service providers to host or otherwis e process \nsome of our data and that of platform users, and they have experienced, and may again experience, security and privacy incident s. Any \nfailure by such third party to prevent or mitigate security breaches or improper access to, or use, acquisition, disclosure, al teration, or \ndestruction of, such data could have similar adverse consequences for us. \nThis risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions with stringent privacy laws and, as we expand our products, offerings, and operations \ndomestically and internationally, we have been, and may continue to become subject to amended or additional laws that impose \nsubstantial additional obligations related to data privacy and security. The EU adopted the GDPR in 2016, and it became effecti ve in \nMay 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent  requirements for controllers and processors of personal dat a. \nSuch requirements include higher consent standards to process pe rsonal data, robust disclosures regarding the use of personal d ata, \nstrengthened individual data rights, data br each requirements, limitations on data re tention, strengthened requirements for spe cial \ncategories of personal data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, and additional obligations for contracting with service providers \nthat may process personal data. In addition, the GDPR contains a provision that individuals shall have the right not to be subj ect to a \ndecision based solely on automated processing, including profiling,  which produces legal effects concerning them or similarly \nsignificantly affects them. Decisions based on AI or on automated processing of data, or  insufficient disclosures regarding thi s \nprocessing, have and could impair our business and have and coul d subject us to lawsuits, regulatory investigations or other harm. The \nGDPR further provides that EU member states may institute additional laws and regulations impacting the processing of personal data, \nincluding (i) special categories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, po litical opinions, and re ligious or philosophical beliefs) \nand (ii) certain decisions based solely on automated processing, including profiling. Such additional laws and regulations coul d limit \nour ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs and harming our business and financial condition. Non-\ncompliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acqui red business) is subject to si gnificant penalties, including  \nfines of up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of total worl dwide revenue, and injunctions ag ainst the processing of personal data. \nOther jurisdictions outside the EU are simi larly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulation s, \nincluding for automated processing, decision making, and profiling, which will increase  our compliance costs and the risks asso ciated \nwith non-compliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which provided new privacy rights for ",
          " \n38 \nconsumers and new operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA includes a statutory damages \nframework and private rights of action against businesses that fa il to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable \nsecurity procedures and pr actices to prevent data breaches. Other U.S. states have adopted, and likely will continue to adopt, similar \nlaws that provide new consumer privacy rights and business operational requirements. Brazil provides another example, having passed \nthe General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais, or LGPD) in 2018, which is now in effect. These laws \nmay be subject to amendments and regulations that may change over time, or result in additional follow-on laws such as the California \nPrivacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) passed in Cali fornia in November 2020. For further inform ation on risks related to our use of certa in \ndecisions based solely on automated processing or profiling, see th e risk factor titled “—Our growing use of artificial intelli gence and \nmachine learning may present additional risks, including risks asso ciated with algorithm development or use, the tools and data  sets \nused, and/or a complex, developing regulatory environment.” \nAdditionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations re garding cross-border tr ansfers of personal data, including laws \nrelating to transfer of personal data outside the EEA. We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws. Such mechanis ms \nhave received heightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny and have undergone modi fications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of  \nJustice of the European Union had cast doubt on the adequacy of all of the formerly-approved mechanisms for transferring person al \ndata from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States. While in July 2023 the European Commission  \ndeemed a new EU-US Data Privacy Framework adequate for personal data transfers from the EU (and the rest of the EEA) to the \nUnited States, this Framework has been ch allenged. If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from  the \nEEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to  transfer personal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees  in \nthose regions, which could have an advers e effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results, and has resulted  in and \nmay result in substantial fines, enforcemen t actions, litigation, injunctive relief, and other penalties that may be costly or that may \nimpact our business. In addition, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, \nincluding from state and city regulators as a requirement for obtai ning or maintaining a license or otherwise, from law enforce ment \nagencies, and from intelligence agencies. This disclosure or pot ential disclosure may result in a failure or perceived failure by us to \ncomply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, and regulations, could result in proceedings or actions against us \nin the same or other jurisdictions, and could have an adverse im pact on our reputation and brand. In addition, Careem has histo rically \nshared certain user data with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global po licies regarding data use, shar ing, and \nownership. We expect to maintain our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem’s business, an d \ndoing so may cause our relationship with government authorities in  certain jurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such gove rnment \nauthorities assessing fines or penalties against us. Further, if  any jurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or \nregulations relating to data residency or local computation such th at we are unable to comply in a timely manner or at all, we may risk \nlosing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. This could a dversely affect the manner in which we provide our products and  \nofferings and thus materially affect our operations and financial results. \nSuch data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and their interpretation is rapi dly evolving, making implementation \nand enforcement, and thus compliance requirements, ambiguous, un certain, and potentially inconsistent. This includes, for examp le, \nthose relating to the processing of data for purposes of advert ising and profile creation, whic h are subject to evolving disclo sure, \nchoice, and consent requirements in the EU, United States, and ot her jurisdictions. Compliance with such laws may require changes to \nour data collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing and certain other related business practices and may thereby increase \ncompliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our operations. A dditionally, any failure or perceived failure by us to comply w ith \nprivacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, orders  and regulations could result in proceedings or actions again st us by \nindividuals, consumer rights groups, government al entities or agencies, or others. We could incur significant costs investigati ng and \ndefending such claims and, if found liable, significant damages. Further, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may \nsubject us to significant penalties and negative publicity. If a ny of these events were to occur, our business and financial re sults could \nbe significantly disrupted and adversely affected. ",
          " \n39 \nAdverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved could expose us to \nmonetary damages or limit our ability to operate our business. \nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the fu ture become, involved in private actions, collective actions, \ninvestigations, and various other legal proceedings by Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, Carriers, employees, commercial  \npartners, competitors or, government agenci es, among others. We are currently party to various legal and regulatory matters tha t have \narisen in the normal course of business and include, among others , alleged independent contractor misclassification claims, Fair Credit \nReporting Act (“FCRA”) claims, alleged bac kground check violations, pricing and advert ising claims, unfair competition claims, \nintellectual property claims, employment di scrimination and other employment-related cl aims, Americans with Disabilities Act \n(“ADA”) claims, data a nd privacy claims, securities claims , antitrust claims, personal injury  claims, challenge s to regulations , and \nother matters. The results of any such litigation, investigations, and legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and expensive. Any \nclaims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time c onsuming, costly, and harmful to our reputation, and could requir e \nsignificant amounts of management time and corporate resources. If any of these legal proceedings were to be determined adversely to \nus, or we were to enter into a settlement, we could be exposed to  monetary damages or be forced to change the way in which we \noperate our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. \nIn addition, we regularly include arbitrat ion provisions in our terms of service with  end-users. These provisions are intended to \nstreamline the litigation process fo r all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than lit igating \ndisputes in state or federal court. However, arbitration may beco me more costly for us, or the volume of arbitrations may increase and \nbecome burdensome. Further, the use of arb itration provisions may subject us to certain  risks to our reputation and brand, as t hese \nprovisions have been the subject of increasi ng public scrutiny. To minimize these risks, we have in the past and may in the fut ure \nvoluntarily limit our use of arbitr ation provisions, or we may be required to do so, in any legal or regulatory proceeding, eit her of \nwhich could increase our litigation costs and exposure in respect of such proceedings. For example, effective May 15, 2018, we ended \nmandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct claims by platform users and employees. \nFurther, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceabili ty of arbitration on a state-by-state bas is, as \nwell as conflicting rules between state and federal law, some or  all of our arbitration provisions  could be subject to challeng e or may \nneed to be revised to exempt certain categories of protection.  If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in  whole \nor in part, or specific claims were required to be exempted from arbitration, we could experience an increase in our litigation costs and \nthe time involved in resolving such disput es, and we could face increased exposure to  potentially costly lawsuits, each of which could \nadversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects. \nWe have operations in countries known to experience high levels of corruption and were previously subject to, and may in the \nfuture be subject to, inquiries, investiga tions, and requests for inform ation with respect to our compliance w ith a number of a nti-\ncorruption laws to which we are subject. \nWe have operations in, and have business relationships with, en tities in countries known to experience high levels of corruptio n. \nWe are subject to the FCPA and other similar laws outside the Un ited States that prohibit improper payments or offers of paymen ts to \nforeign officials, foreign political parties, or candidates for foreign political office for th e purpose of obtaining or retain ing business. \nU.S. and non-U.S. regulators alike continue  to focus on the enfo rcement of these laws, and we may be subject to additional \ncompliance requirements to identify criminal  activity and payments to sanctioned partie s. Our activities in certain countries w ith high \nlevels of corruption enhance the risk of una uthorized payments or offers of payments by Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers  or \nCarriers, employees, consultants, or business partners in viol ation of various anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, even t hough \nthe actions of these parties are often outside our control. Our acquisition of Careem may further enhance this risk because use rs of \nCareem’s platform and Careem’s employees, consultants, and business partners may not be familiar with, and may not have been \npreviously subject to, these anti-corruption laws. In addition,  our existing and future safeguards, including training and comp liance \nprograms to discourage these practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for whi ch we \ncould be held responsible. Additional compliance requirements may compel us to revise or expand our compliance program, including \nthe procedures we use to verify the identity of platform users and monitor international and domestic transactions. ",
          " \n40 \nDrivers may become subject to in creased licensing requirements, and we may be re quired to obtain additional licenses or cap the  \nnumber of Drivers using our platform. \nMany Drivers currently are not required to obtain a commercial ta xi or livery license in their respective jurisdictions. Howeve r, \nnumerous jurisdictions in which we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including \nmarkets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and \nAfrica, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to be  licensed with local authorities or require us or our \nsubsidiaries to be licensed as a transportation company. Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Drivers may adversely affect \nour ability to scale our business and operations. In addition, it is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number of \nlicensed Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or im pose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work, \nsimilar to recent regulations that were adopted in Spain and Ne w York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for \nDrivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers become subj ect to such caps, limitations, or licensing requirements, our bu siness \nand growth prospects would be adversely impacted. \nWe may be subject to liability for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers. \nWe operate in an industry in which the comp etition for Drivers is intense. In this highly competitive environment, the means we  \nuse to onboard and attract Driver s may be challenged by competitors , government regulators, or i ndividual plaintiffs. For examp le, \nputative class actions have been filed by in dividual plaintiffs against us for allege d violation of the Telephone Consumer Prot ection \nAct of 1991, alleging, among other things, that plaintiffs received  text messages from us regard ing our Driver program without their \nconsent or after indicating to us they no longer wished to r eceive such text messages. These lawsuits are expensive and time \nconsuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could resu lt in material financial damages and penalties, costly adjustm ents to \nour business practices, and negative publicity. In addition, we could incur substantial expense and possible loss of revenue if  \ncompetitors file additional lawsuits or other claims challenging these practices. \nOur business depends heavily on insurance coverage for Drivers and on other types of insurance for additional risks related to our \nbusiness. If insurance carriers change the terms of such insurance in a manner not favorable to Drivers or to us, if we are \nrequired to purchase additional in surance for other aspects of our business, or if  we fail to comply w ith regulations governing  \ninsurance coverage, our business could be harmed. \nWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance \nsubsidiary. Insurance related to our Mobilit y products may include thir d-party automobile, automob ile comprehensive and collisi on, \nphysical damage, and uninsured and underinsured  motorist coverage. We require Drivers to carry automobile insurance in most \ncountries, and in many cases we also maintain insurance on behalf  of Drivers. We rely on a limited number of ridesharing insura nce \nproviders, and should such providers discontinue  or increase the cost of coverage, we cannot guarantee that we would be able to  \nsecure replacement coverage on reasonable terms or at all. In addition to insurance related to our products, we maintain other \nautomobile insurance coverage for owned vehicles and employee activity, as well as insurance coverage for non-automotive corpor ate \nrisks including general liability, workers’ compensation, property, cyber liability, a nd director and officers’ liability. If o ur insurance \ncarriers change the terms of our policies in a manner unfavorable to us or Drivers, our insurance costs could increase. The cos t of \ninsurance that we maintain on behalf of Drivers is higher in th e United States and Canada than in other geographies. Further, i f the \ninsurance coverage we maintain is not adequate to cover losses that occur, we could be liable for significant additional costs. \nIn addition, we and our captive insurance subsidiary are party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that \ntransfer a significant portion of the risk from the insurance pr ovider to us or our captive insurance subsidiary, which could r equire us \nto pay out material amounts that  may be in excess of our insu rance reserves, including as a re sult of adverse legal proceedings , \nresulting in harm to our financial condition. Our insurance rese rves include amounts for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expe nses \nfor risks retained by us through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms. Such amounts are based o n \nactuarial estimates, historical claim inform ation, and industry data. While management  believes that these reserve amounts are \nadequate, the ultimate liability could be in excess of our rese rves. Insurance recoverables are recognized when we enter into contracts \nthat transfer the risk recorded in our insurance reserves to th ird-party insurance companies. We  also have requirements to post  \ncollateral for current and future claim sett lement obligations with certain of our in surance carriers, which may have a signifi cant \nimpact on our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available for general business purposes. \nWe may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traf fic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have \nbeen caused by Drivers who use our platform, even when those Driv ers are not actively using our pl atform or when an individual \nimpersonates a Driver, by consumers using our services, or by thir d parties. As we expand to include more offerings on our plat form, \nour insurance needs will likely extend to those additional offerings, including Freight. As a result, our automobile liability and general \nliability insurance policies and insurance maintained by Drivers may not cover al l potential claims related to traffic accidents, injuries, \nor other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Driv ers who use our platform or where liability is otherwise alleged  against \nus, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that we could face. Even if these claims do not result in liabili ty, we could \nincur significant costs in investigating and defending against them . If insurers become insolvent, they may not be able to pay \notherwise valid claims in a timely manner or at all. If we are s ubject to claims of liability relating to the acts of Drivers or others using \nour platform, we may be subject to negative publicity and incur additional expenses, which could harm our business, financial ",
          " \n41 \ncondition, and operating results. \nIn addition, we are subject to local laws, rules, and regulations relating to insurance coverage which could result in proceedings or \nactions against us by governmental entities or others. Legislation has been passed in many U.S. jurisdictions that codifies the se \ninsurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Additional legislation has b een proposed in other jurisdictions that seeks to codify \nor change insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Further, service providers and bus iness customers of Freight and Uber \nfor Business may require higher levels of coverage as a conditi on to entering into certain key contracts with us. Any failure, or \nperceived failure, by us to comply with lo cal laws, rules, and regulations or contra ctual obligations relating to insurance cov erage \ncould result in proceedings or actions ag ainst us by governmental entitie s or others. These lawsuits , proceedings, or actions m ay \nsubject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, require  us to increase our insurance coverage, require us to amend our \ninsurance policy disclosure, increase our costs, and disrupt our business. \nWe may be subject to pricing regulations, as well as related litigation or regulatory inquiries. \nOur revenue is dependent on the pricing models we use to calc ulate consumer fares and Driver earnings. Our pricing models, \nincluding dynamic pricing, ha ve been, and will likely continue  to be, challenged, banned, limit ed in emergencies, and capped in  \ncertain jurisdictions. For example, we have agreed to not calcu late consumer fares in excess of the maximum government-mandated  \nfares in all major Indian cities where legal proceedings have limit ed the use of surge pricing. Further, in 2018, Honolulu, Haw aii \nbecame the first U.S. city to pass legislation to cap surge pricing if increased rates exceed the maximum fare set by the city.  Additional \nregulation of our pricing models could incr ease our operating costs and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, our pricing  model \nhas been the subject of litigation and regul atory inquiries related to, among other thi ngs, the calculation of and statements r egarding \nconsumer fares and Driver earnings (including rates, fees, surcharges, and tolls), as well as the use of surge pricing during emergencies \nand natural disasters. In addition, an increasing number of m unicipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect  to our \nDelivery offering and caps on surge pricing with respect to our M obility offering. As a result, we may be forced to change our pricing \nmodels in certain jurisdictions, which could harm our revenue or result in a sub-optimal tax structure. \nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if th ird parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriat ing the \nintellectual property of others, we may incur significant expense and our business may be adversely affected. \nOur intellectual property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code, \nfirmware, hardware and hardware designs, registered and unregis tered trademarks, trademark applications, copyrights, trade secr ets, \ninventions (whether or not patentable), pa tents, and patent applications. We believe that our intellectual property is essentia l to our \nbusiness and affords us a competitive advantage in the markets in  which we operate. If we do not adequately protect our intelle ctual \nproperty, our brand and reputation may be ha rmed, Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shi ppers, and Carriers could devalue our produ cts \nand offerings, and our ability to compete effectively may be impaired. \nTo protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademar k, patent, and trade secret laws, contract ual \nprovisions, end-user policies, and disclosure  restrictions. Upon discovery of potentia l infringement of our intellectual proper ty, we \nassess and when necessary, take action to protect our rights as appropriate. We also enter into confidentiality agreements and invention \nassignment agreements with our employees and consultants and se ek to control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary \ninformation in a commercially prudent manner. The efforts we have taken and may take to protect our intellectual property may n ot be \nsufficient or effective. For example, effective intellectual pr operty protection may not be availa ble in every country in which  we \ncurrently or in the future will operate. In  addition, it may be possible for other parties to copy or reverse-engineer our prod ucts and \nofferings or obtain and use the content of our website without authorization. Further, we may be unable to prevent competitors or other \nthird parties from acquiring or using domain names or trademarks that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of o ur \ndomain names, trademarks, service marks, and other proprietary rights. Moreover, our trade secr ets may be compromised by third \nparties or our employees, which would cause  us to lose the competitive advantage de rived from the compromi sed trade secrets. \nFurther, we may be unable to detect infringe ment of our intellectual prope rty rights, and even if we detect such violations and  decide \nto enforce our intellectual prope rty rights, we may not be successful, and may in cur significant expenses, in such efforts. In addition, \nany such enforcement efforts may be time-consuming and may divert management’s attention. Further, such enforcement efforts may \nresult in a ruling that our intellectual pr operty rights are unenforceable or invalid. Any failure to protect or any loss of ou r intellectual \nproperty may have an adverse effect on our ability to compete and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating \nresults. \nCompanies in the Internet and technology industries, and other patent and trademark holders, including “non-practicing entities,” \nseeking to profit from royalties in connec tion with grants of licenses or seeking to  obtain injunctions, own large numbers of p atents, \ncopyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and frequently enter in to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other vi olations of \nintellectual property rights. We have and may in the future continue to receive notices that claim we have misappropriated, misused, or \ninfringed upon other parties’ intellectual property rights. \nFurthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products, including in areas in which we historically have not \noperated, which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims. In addition, we, and companies we  \nacquired or in which we have an interest, have been sued, and may in the future be sued, for allegations of intellectual proper ty \ninfringement or threats of trade secret misappropriation. If a company we acquire or in which we have an interest loses rights to ",
          " \n42 \nvaluable intellectual property or is found to infringe third part y intellectual property rights in such lawsuits, the value of our \ninvestment may materially decline. \nAny intellectual property claim against us, regardless of merit, c ould be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate, c ould \ndivert our management’s atten tion and other resources, and c ould hurt goodwill associated with our  brand. These claims may also  \nsubject us to significant liability for damages and may result in us having to stop using tec hnology, content, branding, or bus iness \nmethods found to be in viol ation of another party’s rights. Further, certain adverse outcomes of such proceedings could adverse ly \naffect our ability to compete effectively in existing or future businesses. \nWe may be required or may opt to seek a license for the right to use intellectual property held by others, which may not be \navailable on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if a license is available, we may be required to pay significant ro yalties or \nlicense fees, which may increase our operating expenses. We ma y also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technolo gy, \ncontent, branding, or business methods, which could require significant effort and expense and make us less competitive. If we cannot \nlicense or develop alternative technology, c ontent, branding, or business methods for any allegedly infringing aspect of our bu siness, \nwe may be unable to compete effectively or we may be prevente d from operating our business in certain jurisdictions. Any of the se \nresults could harm our operating results.  \nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles. \nThe accounting for our business is complicate d, particularly in the area of revenue recognition, and is subject to change based  on \nthe evolution of our business model, interpretations of relevant  accounting principles, enforcement of existing or new regulati ons, and \nchanges in SEC or other agency policies, rules, regulations, and interpretations, of accounting regulations. Changes to our bus iness \nmodel and accounting methods could result in changes to our financ ial statements, including changes in revenue and expenses in any \nperiod, or in certain categories of revenue and expenses moving to different periods, may result in materially different financial results, \nand may require that we change how we process, analyze, and report financial information and our financial reporting controls. \nIf we are deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act, applicable restrictions could have an adverse effect \non our business. \nThe Investment Company Act contains substantive legal requirem ents that regulate the manner in which “investment companies” \nare permitted to conduct their business activities. We believe that we have conducted our business in a manner that does not re sult in \nbeing characterized as an “investment co mpany” under the Investment Company Act because we are primarily engaged in a non-\ninvestment company business. Although a signi ficant portion of our assets constitute investments in non-controlled entities (in cluding \nin China), referred to elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as minority-owned entities, we  believe that we are not an \ninvestment company as defi ned by the Investment Compa ny Act. While we intend to conduct our operations such that we will not be  \ndeemed an investment company, such a determination would requi re us to initiate burdensome compliance requirements and comply \nwith restrictions imposed by the Investment Company Act that would limit our activities, including limitations on our capital s tructure \nand our ability to transact with subsidiaries and other entities, which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition. To avoid \nsuch a determination, we may be required to conduct our business in a manner that does not subject us to the requirements of th e \nInvestment Company Act, which could have an adverse effect on our  business. For example, we may be required to sell certain of our \nassets and pay significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of such assets. \nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock \nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile or may decline steeply or suddenly regardless o f \nour operating performance, and we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations. You may not be able to resell your \nshares at or above the price you paid and may lose all or part of your investment. \nThe market price of our common stock may fl uctuate or decline significantly in respons e to numerous factors, many of which are \nbeyond our control, including: \n• actual or anticipated fluctuations in MAPCs, Trips, Adju sted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Gross Bookings, revenue, or \nother operating and financial results; \n• announcements by us or estimates by third parties of actual  or anticipated changes in the number of Drivers and \nconsumers on our platform; \n• variations between our actual operating resu lts and the expectations of our manageme nt, securities analysts, investors, the \nfinancial community; \n• changes in accounting principles or changes in interpretations of existing principles, which could affect financial results; \n• actions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain cove rage of us, changes in financ ial estimates by any securities \nanalysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors; \n• announcements by us or our competitors of  significant products  or features, tec hnical innovations, acquisitions, strategic \npartnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments; ",
          " \n43 \n• negative media coverage or publicity; \n• changes in operating performance and stock market valuati ons of technology companies ge nerally, or those in our \nindustry in particular, including our competitors; \n• price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole; \n• lawsuits threatened, filed, or decided against us; \n• developments in legislation or regulat ory actions, including interim or final rulings by judicial or regulatory bodies \n(including any competition authorities blocking, delaying, or subjecting our pending acquisitions to significant limitations \nor restrictions on our ability to operate in one or more markets, or requiring us to divest our or any target company’s assets \nor businesses in one or more markets); \n• changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles; \n• any major change in our board of directors or management; \n• any safety incidents or public reports of safety incidents that occur on our platform or in our industry; \n• statements, commentary, or opinions by p ublic officials that our product offerings are or may be unlawful, regardless of \nany interim or final rulings by judicial or regulatory bodies; \n• any trading activity in our share repurchase program; and \n• other events or factors, including those re sulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, public health concerns \nor epidemics, pandemics, natural disasters, or responses to these events. \nIn addition, price and volume fluctuations in the stock markets have affected and continue to affect many technology companies’ \nstock prices. Often, their stock prices have fluctuated in ways  unrelated or disproportionate to the companies’ operating performance. \nIn the past, stockholders have filed securities class action lit igation following periods of market volatility. For example, be ginning in \nSeptember 2019, several putative class actions were filed in Cali fornia state and federal courts against us, our directors, cer tain of our \nofficers, and the underwriters named in our IPO registration statem ent alleging violations of secu rities laws in connection wit h our \nIPO. Securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and \nseriously harm our business. In addition, the occurrence of a ny of the factors listed above, among others, may cause our stock price to \ndecline significantly, and there can be no assurance that our stoc k price would recover. As such, you may not be able to sell y our \nshares at or above the price you paid, and you may lose some or all of your investment. \nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could \nmake a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our common stock. \nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amende d and restated bylaws contain pr ovisions that could depress the  \ntrading price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in o ur \nmanagement that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions include the following: \n• our board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill vacancies created by the expansion of our board of directors or  \nthe resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board \nof directors; \n• advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals, which may reduce the number of stockholder proposals available \nfor stockholder consideration; \n• limitations on stockholder ability to c onvene special stockholder meetings, which could ma ke it difficult for our \nstockholders to adopt desired governance changes; \n• prohibition on cumulative voting in  the election of directors, which limits th e ability of minority st ockholders to elect \ndirector candidates; and \n• our board of directors is able  to issue, without stockholder approval, shares  of undesignated preferred stock, which makes \nit possible for our board of directors to i ssue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede \nthe success of any attempt to acquire us. \nAny provision of our amended and restated cer tificate of incorporation, amended and re stated bylaws, or Delaware law that has \nthe effect of delaying or deterring a cha nge in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium f or their \nshares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that  some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. In add ition, \nunder our existing debt instruments, we, a nd certain of our subsidiaries, are subjec t to certain limitations on our business an d \noperations, including limitations on certain consolidations, merger s, and sales of assets. For information regarding these and other \nprovisions, see the risk fa ctor titled “—We have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in the future incur additional \nindebtedness. Our payment obligations under such indebtedness ma y limit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt ",
          " \n44 \nagreements may restrict our flexibility in operating our business.”  \nSales, directly or indirectly, of shares of our common stock by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline. \nSales, directly or indirectly, of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the public perception that these sales might \noccur, could depress the market price of our common stock and c ould impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of add itional \nequity securities. We may issue our shares of common stock or s ecurities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for ou r \ncommon stock from time to time in connection w ith a financing, acquisition, investments or otherwise. Such issuances, including  the \nissuance of additional shares of our common stock upon exercise of  equity awards or conversion of our convertible notes, could result \nin substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. \nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future. \nWe have never declared or paid cash divi dends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to financ e \nthe operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable futur e. In \naddition, certain of our existi ng debt instruments include rest rictions on our ability to pay cash dividends. As a result, you may only \nreceive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases. \nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides th at the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and, to the \nextent enforceable, the federal district courts of the United St ates of America are the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes \nbetween us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholde rs’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with \nus or our directors, officers, or employees. \nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the \nexclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law: \n• any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; \n• any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; \n• any action asserting a claim against us or our directors, officers, or employees arising under the Delaware General \nCorporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws; \n• any action regarding our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; \n• any action as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State \nof Delaware; and \n• any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal-affairs doctrine. \nThis provision would not apply to suits brou ght to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim f or \nwhich the U.S. federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. \nOur amended and restated certificate of inco rporation provides that the federal district  courts of the United States of America will \nbe the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cau se of action arising under the Securities Act, subject to and  \ncontingent upon a final adjudication in the St ate of Delaware of the enforceability of such exclusive forum provision. Although  the \nDelaware Supreme Court has held that such exclusive forum provi sions are facially valid, courts in other jurisdictions may find  such \nprovisions to be unenforceable. \nThese exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable  for \ndisputes with us or our direct ors, officers, or other employees, which may disc ourage lawsuits against us and our directors, of ficers, \nand other employees. If any other court of competent jurisdiction were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and \nrestated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable, we may incur additional costs associated with resolv ing the \ndispute in other jurisdictions, which could seriously harm our business. \nIf we are unable to maintain effective in ternal control over financial reporting in the future, investors may lose confidence i n the \naccuracy and completeness of our financial reports, and the market price of our common stock may be harmed. \nAs a result of being a public company, we are obligated to de velop and maintain proper and effective internal controls over \nfinancial reporting, and any failure to maintain the adequacy of these internal controls may adversely affect investor confiden ce in our \ncompany and, as a result, the value of our common stock. \nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“Section 404”), to furnish an annual report by management \non, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public \naccounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our  internal control over financial annually. We currently are re quired to \ndisclose changes in internal control over financial reporting that  have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materi ally affect, \nour internal control over financial reporting on a quarterly basis. \nThe process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with ",
          " \n45 \nSection 404 is costly and challenging, and we may not be able to  complete evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in a \ntimely fashion. As our business continues to grow in size and complexity, we are improving our processes and infrastructure to help \nensure we can prepare financial reporting and disclosures within the timeline required for a public company. During the evaluation and \ntesting process of our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weakness es in our internal control over financial reporting, \nwe will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. \nWe cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future,  \nwhich may cause challenges in consistent performance and timely de signing new controls. Any failure to maintain internal contro l \nover financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability  to accurately report our financ ial condition or operating results. If we are \nunable to conclude that our internal control over financial repor ting is effective, or if we or  our independent registered publ ic \naccounting firm determines we have a material weakness in our in ternal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor  \nconfidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and w e \ncould be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock ex change on which our securities are listed, the SEC or other regu latory \nauthorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain these \nand other effective control systems, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets. \nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS \nNot applicable. \nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY \nSafeguarding our critical networks and the information that platform users share with us is vital to our business. One key way that \nUber addresses this need is through its cybersecurity program, which includes a cybersecurity risk management program. \nUber’s Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) is respons ible for the cybersecurity program, which is coordinated and \nprimarily executed by the global organization of engineers focu sed on risk management using the NIST Framework (Govern, Identify, \nProtect, Detect, Respond, and Recover) and activities such as automation, secure development, and advanced analytics and \nmonitoring. The CISO has served in such role since February 202 1 and has more than 20+ years of  engineering and/or cybersecurit y \nexperience, including previously as CISO and Deputy Chief Technology Officer at a Fortune 500 company. \nThe cybersecurity program is also supported by Uber’s Chie f Privacy Officer and Associate General Counsel, Privacy & \nCybersecurity (“CPO”), who has served in that role since August 2018. The CPO has over three decades of experience as a legal \nadvisor to multinational corporat ions, including serving as Chief Privacy & Security Counsel fo r a Fortune 100 technology compa ny \nprior to her role at Uber. \nThe cybersecurity program is supported by other members of Uber’s  senior management team as well, including the Chief Legal \nOfficer, Chief Architect Officer, and Global Data Protection Offi cer. Uber’s Board of Directors oversees the cybersecurity prog ram \nthrough regular updates.  \nThis cybersecurity program is a critical component of Uber’s enterprise risk mana gement program, through which Uber reviews \nbusiness, cybersecurity, informa tion technology, privacy, legal, and geopolitical risks, among ot hers. The cybersecurity progra m is \ndesigned to assess, identify, and manage risks from cybersecurity threats. \nKey elements of this program include:  \n• Oversight and Governance.  Uber’s Board oversees the cybersecurity program, and Uber’s risk profile with respect to \ncybersecurity matters, through regular reports and reviews. These include presentations by the CISO to the Board and \nAudit Committee on an alternating quarterly basis, quarterly re ports of certain cybersecurity incidents to the Board, and \nannual reports by the CPO to the Board. \nThe CISO also provides quarterly updates to Uber’s senior management regarding cybersecurity risks, as well as interim \nupdates during regular meetings with Uber’s engineering, pr oduct and internal audit leadership. The CISO and CPO also \njointly chair Uber’s Privacy and Cybersecurity Council, which provides a venue for cross-functional insight and input into \nthe cybersecurity program and our privacy program as they relate to Uber’s business operations. \n• Internally conducted environment and vulnerability assessments.  These include regular assessments performed by \nUber’s security engineering teams. The findings from thes e assessments are reported to Uber’s senior management, \nincluding the CISO, and the Board or Audit Committee. In a ddition, our internal audit function periodically conducts \nadditional reviews and assessments, which are reported to th e Audit Committee. We also conduct table-top exercises to \nsimulate the response to cybersecurity incidents; partic ipants may include, among others, the CISO, the CPO, and \nrepresentatives from communications, investor relations, finance and legal. \n• Independent third-party audits and assessments by industry-leading firms. As a global organization, Uber undergoes \nannual audits to maintain its certification as a Payment Card  Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS 4.0) Level 1 \nMerchant and Service provider. Uber also undergoes annual audits to maintain its ISO 27001 certification for its core \nmobility, delivery, and enterprise businesses, and SOC 2 attestations that vary depending on the Uber product.  ",
          " \n46 \n• Cyber incident management. This includes efforts by Uber’s security engineering team, at the direction of the CISO, to \nreview potential incidents identified by Uber’s internal teams, Uber’s third-party service providers or external researchers \nthrough Uber’s Bug Bounty program; identify those which represen t potential or actual threats to Uber’s systems, data or \nusers; investigate and mitigate the cause and impact of su ch incidents; and implement safeguards to help prevent \nrecurrence. Uber’s CPO and legal team support such efforts, including in connection with legal or disclosure obligations \ntriggered in connection with any such incidents.  \n• Third Party Risk Management.  Uber performs due diligence regarding its third-party suppliers, service providers and \nbusiness partners. This includes requiring submission of evid ence demonstrating third partie s’ ability to meet Uber’s \ncybersecurity and data handling requirements. In addition, Ub er’s third-party suppliers and service providers who process \nUber personal data are contractually obligated to notify Uber if they experience certain incidents impacting Uber personal \ndata. \nFor a discussion regarding risks from cybersecurity threats, see our  risk factors, including the risk factors titled “—We have \nexperienced, and may experience security or privacy breaches or  other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, disclosure of , \nalteration of or destruction of our proprietary or confidential data, employee data , or platform user data, which could cause l oss of \nrevenue, harm to our brand, business disr uption, and significant liabilities”, “—C yberattacks, including computer malware, \nransomware, viruses, denial of service at tacks, spamming, phishing and social engineering attacks could harm our reputation, \nbusiness, and operating results”, “—We currently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for informa tion \nfrom the DOJ, other federal, state and local government agencies  and other foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes of  \nwhich could harm our business” and “—We face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing o f data, \nwhich could result in investiga tions, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative and regulator y action, and negative press about  our privacy \nand data protection practices” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nITEM 2. PROPERTIES \nAs of December 31, 2024, we leased and ow ned office facilities around the world tota ling 8.8 million square  feet, including 2.1  \nmillion square feet for our corporate headquarters in the San Francisco Bay Area, California. \nWe believe our facilities, which are generally used by all of our reportable segments, are adequate and suitable for our curren t \nneeds and that should it be needed, suitable additional or alternative space will be available to accommodate our operations. \nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS \nWe are a party to various legal actions a nd government investigations, and similar or  other actions could be brought against us  in \nthe future. The most significant of these matters are described below. \nLegal Proceedings Described in Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies to Our Consolidated Financial Statements  \nNote 14 – Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024 \ncontained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K includes information on legal proceedings that constitute material contingencies f or \nfinancial reporting purposes that could have a material adverse effect on our consolid ated financial position, liquidity or res ults of \noperations if they were resolved in a manner that is adverse to us. This item should be read in conjunction with Note 14 for \ninformation regarding the following material legal proceedings, which information is incorporated into this item by reference: \n• Driver Classification \n• State Unemployment Taxes \nLegal Proceedings That Are Not Described in Note 14 – Co mmitments and Contingencies to Our Consolidated Financial \nStatements \nIn addition to the matters that are iden tified in Note 14 – Commitments and Con tingencies to our consolidated financial \nstatements for the year ended December 31, 2024 contained in this  Annual Report on Form 10-K, and incorporated into this item b y \nreference, the following matters also constitute material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary course litigation inci dental to \nour business, to which we are or any of our subsidiaries is a party. \nAustralia Class Actions \nIn May 2019, an Australian law firm filed a class action in the Supreme Court of Vict oria, Australia, against us and certain of  our \nsubsidiaries, on behalf of certain participants in the taxi, hi re-car, and limousine industries. The plaintiff alleges that the  Uber entities \nconspired to injure the group members during the period 2014 to 2017 by either directly breach ing transport legislation or \ncommissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Drivers in Australia. The claim alleges, in effect, that these op erations \ncaused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value of certain taxi  \nlicenses. In March, April and Oc tober 2020, the same Australian law firm filed four additional class action lawsuits alleging the same \nclaim. In December 2024, the Supreme Court of Victoria approved a settlement with no admission of liability by Uber. The approval is \nsubject to any appeals and the approval of the Supreme Court of Western Australia. ",
          " \n47 \nOther Legal Proceedings \nWhile it is not possible to dete rmine the outcome of the legal actions, investigations , and proceedings brought against us, we \nbelieve that, except for the matters described above, the resoluti on of all such matters will not have a material adverse effec t on our \nconsolidated financial position or liquidity, but could be materi al to our consolidated results of operations in any one accoun ting \nperiod. We are currently involved in, and may in the future be  involved in, legal proceedings, litigation, claims, and governme nt \ninvestigations in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to the \nclassification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with a pplicable law. This risk is e nhanced in certain jurisdictions outside \nthe United States where we may be less protected under local laws  than we are in the United States. Although the results of the  legal \nproceedings, claims, and gove rnment investigations in  which we are involved ca nnot be predicted with certainty, we do not belie ve \nthat the final outcome of these matters is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condi tion, or \noperating results. Regardless of final outcomes, however, any such legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations may  \nnonetheless impose a significant burden on ma nagement and employees and may come with costly defense costs or unfavorable \npreliminary and interim rulings. \nITEM 4.

          " \n49 \nOverview \nWe are a technology platform that uses a massive network, lead ing technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to \npower movement from point A to point B. We develop and opera te proprietary technology appli cations supporting a variety of \nofferings on our platform. We connect consumers with providers of  ride services, merchants as we ll as delivery service provider s for \nmeal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Uber also  connects consumers with public transportation networks. We use  this \nsame network, technology, operational excellence, and product expert ise to connect Shippers with Carriers in the freight indust ry by \nproviding Carriers with the ability to book a shipment, transportation management and other logistics services. We are also developing \ntechnologies designed to provide new solutions to solve everyday problems. \nDriver Classification Developments \nThe classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United \nStates and abroad. We are involved in nu merous legal proceedings gl obally, including putative class and collective class action  \nlawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before admi nistrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, so cial \nsecurity, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be  treated as our employees (or as  workers or quasi-employees where those \nstatuses exist), rather than as independent  contractors. Of particular  note are proceedings in California, where on May 5, 2020 , the \nCalifornia Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in \nSan Francisco Superior C ourt (the “Court”) against Uber and Lyft, Inc., alle ging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an \ninjunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitiv e advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers . To \ncomply with Proposition 22, we ha ve incurred and expect to incu r additional expenses , including expenses associated with a \nguaranteed minimum earnings floor for Drivers, insurance for inju ry protection and subsidies for health care. We do not expect these \nchanges will have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. \nIf, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classi fy Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employ ees \nwhere those statuses exist, we would incur significant additiona l expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses associa ted \nwith the application of wage and hour laws  (including minimum wage, ove rtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee \nbenefits, social security contributions, ta xes (direct and indirect), and potential pe nalties. Additionally, we may not have ad equate \nDriver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able \nto hire a majority of the Driv ers currently using our platform. Any of these ev ents could negatively impact our business, resul ts of \noperations, financial position, and cash flows. \nFor a discussion of risk factors related to how misclassification challenges may impact our business, result of operations, financial \nposition and operating condition and cash flows, see the risk factor  titled “-Our business would be  adversely affected if Drive rs were \nclassified as employees, workers or quasi-employees” included in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, and Note 14 – Commitments and  \nContingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Dat a,” of \nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nIn addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employ ees, this may impact our current financial statement presentation \nincluding revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in Note 1 – Description of Business and Summ ary \nof Significant Accounting Policies in the note s to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financia l \nStatements and Supplementary Data ,” and the section titled “Critical  Accounting Estimates” in Part II, Item 7, of this Annual R eport \non Form 10-K. \nFinancial and Operational Highlights \n  Year Ended December 31, \n(In millions, except percentages)  2023  2024  % Change  \n% Change  \n(Constant Currency (1)) \nMonthly Active Platform Consumers (“MAPCs”) (2), (3)  150  171   14 %   \nTrips (2)  9,448  11,273   19 %   \nGross Bookings (2)  $ 137,865   $ 162,773    18 %   21 % \nRevenue  $ 37,281   $ 43,978    18 %   19 % \nIncome from operations  $ 1,110   $ 2,799    152 %   \nNet income attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc.  $ 1,887   $ 9,856   **   \nAdjusted EBITDA (1), (2)  $ 4,052   $ 6,484    60 %   \nNet cash provided by operating activities (4)  $ 3,585   $ 7,137    99 %   \nFree cash flow (1), (4)  $ 3,362   $ 6,895    105 %   \n(1) See the section titled “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information and reconciliations to the most \ndirectly comparable GAAP financial measure. \n(2) See the section titled “Certain Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for more information.

Delivery Gross Bookings grew 17% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by an increase in Delivery \nTrip volumes. Freight Gross Bookings declined 2% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis. \nRevenue was $44.0 billion, up 18% year-over-year, primarily attributable to an increase in Gro ss Bookings of 18%. The increase \nin Gross Bookings was primarily driven by an  increase in Mobility and Delivery Trip vol umes. The increase in revenue was partia lly \noffset by business model changes in some countries that classifi ed certain sales and marketing costs as contra revenue, which \nnegatively impacted revenue by $863 million and $713 million across Mobility and Delivery, respectively. \nNet income attributable to Uber Technol ogies, Inc. was $9.9 billion, which includes:  (i) a $6.4 billion benefit from the releas e of \nour valuation allowance of certain U.S. federal and state deferr ed tax assets and (ii) the favorable impact of a pre-tax unreal ized gain \non debt and equity securities, ne t, of $1.8 billion primarily rela ted to changes in the fair valu e of our equity securities, in cluding: a \n$723 million net unrealized gain on our Grab investment, a $629 million net unrealized ga in on our Aurora i nvestment, and a $35 7 \nmillion net unrealized gain on our Didi investment.\n \nAdjusted EBITDA was $6.5 billion, grow ing $2.4 billion year-over-year. Mobility Ad justed EBITDA was $6.5 billion, up $1.5 \nbillion year-over-year. Delivery Adjusted EBITDA was $2.5 billi on, up $965 million year-over-year . These increases were partial ly \noffset by a $57 million increase in Corporate G&A and Platform R&D costs, year-over-year \nWe ended the year with $7.0 billion in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. During the fourth quarter of \n2024, we redeemed $2.0 billion of our outsta nding debt. For additional info rmation, see Note 8 – L ong-Term Debt and Revolving \nCredit Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements incl uded in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementa ry \nData,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nIn January 2025, we announced that we en tered into an accelerat ed share repurchase (“ ASR”) agreement with a large financial \ninstitution to repurchase $1.5 billion of our outstanding common stock as  part of our previously  announced Share Repurchase \nProgram. The transactions under the ASR agr eement were completed during the first quarter of 2025. Fo r additional information, see \nNote 10 – Stockholders' Equity to our consolid ated financial statements included in Part  II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and \nSupplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nComponents of Results of Operations \nRevenue \nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for use of our platform. We have concluded \nthat we are an agent in these arrangements as we arrange for ot her parties to provide the service to the end-user. Under this m odel, \nrevenue is net of Driver and Merchant earn ings and Driver incentives. We act as an agent in these transactions by connecting \nconsumers to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a Trip, meal, grocery or other delivery service. In certain markets we are res ponsible \nfor the Mobility or Delivery services (and in most markets we are responsible for the Freight services), and in these markets w e \npresent revenue from end-users and from Shippers on a gross basis, with the payments to Drivers and Carriers classified within cost of \nrevenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\n \nWe would expect revenue to fluctuate on an absolute dollar ba sis for the foreseeable future based upon factors such as Trip \nvolume, Driver supply, macroeconomic conditions, global travel activities and management pricing and promotional activities. During \nthe year ended December 31, 2023, we implemented a business m odel change in certain major markets resulting in end-users \nbecoming our customers. Promotions to end- users considered customers are recognized as  contra-revenue while promotions to end-\nusers not considered customers are recognized as sales and marketing expenses. \nFor additional discussion related to our revenue, see the secti on titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial \nCondition and Results of Operations - Critic al Accounting Estimates - Revenue Recognition”  as well as “Note 1 – Description of \nBusiness and Summary of Significant Acc ounting Policies - Revenue Recognition,” and “Note 2 – Revenue” to our consolidated ",
          " \n51 \nfinancial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nCost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization \nCost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily consists of costs incurred for certain Mobility and Deli very \ntransactions where we are primarily responsible for Mobility a nd Delivery services and pay Drivers and Couriers for services, c ertain \ninsurance costs related to our Mobility and Delivery offerings, costs incurred with Carriers for Uber Freight transportation se rvices, \ncredit card processing fees, bank fees, data center and networki ng expenses, mobile device and service costs, and amounts relat ed to \nfare chargebacks and other credit card losses. \nWe expect that cost of revenue, exclusiv e of depreciation and amortization, will fluc tuate on an absolute dollar basis for the \nforeseeable future primarily driven by Trip volume changes on the platform. \nOperations and Support \nOperations and support expenses primarily consist of compensation expenses, including stock-based compensation, for employees \nthat support operations in cities, including the general managers , Driver operations, platform user support representatives and  \ncommunity managers. Also included is the cost of customer s upport, Driver background checks and the allocation of certain corporate \ncosts. \nWe would expect operations and support expenses to vary from pe riod to period on an absolute dollar basis, but decrease as a \npercentage of revenue as we become more efficient in supporting platform users. \nSales and Marketing \nSales and marketing expenses primarily cons ist of advertising costs, product marketi ng costs, consumer discounts, promotions, \ncredits and refunds provided to end-users who are not customer s, compensation costs, including stock-based compensation to sale s \nand marketing employees, and the allocation of certain corporate costs. We expense advertising and other promotional expenditures as \nincurred. \nWe would expect sales and marketing expenses to vary from pe riod to period as a percentage of revenue due to timing of \nmarketing campaigns. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we implemented a busin ess model change in certain major markets resulting in end-\nusers becoming our customers. Promotions to end-users consider ed customers are recognized as contra-revenue while promotions to  \nend-users not considered customers are recognized as sales and marketing expenses. \nResearch and Development \nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of compen sation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees \nin engineering, design and product development. Expenses also  include ongoing improvements to, and maintenance of, existing \nproducts and services, and allocation of certa in corporate costs. We expense substantially all research and development expense s as \nincurred. \nWe would expect research and development expenses to increase  on an absolute dollar basis and vary from period to period as a \npercentage of revenue as we continue to invest in research and development activities relating to ongoing improvements to and \nmaintenance of our platform offerings and other research and development programs. \nGeneral and Administrative \nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of compen sation costs, including stock-base d compensation, for executive \nmanagement and administrative employees , including finance and accounting, human re sources, policy and communications, legal, \nand certain impairment charges, as well as allocation of certain corporate costs, occupancy, and general corporate insurance co sts. \nGeneral and administrative expenses also include certain legal related accruals and expenses. \nWe would expect general and administrative expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future as our \nbusiness continues to grow and Trip volume increases, but decrease  as a percentage of revenue as we achieve improved fixed cost  \nleverage and efficiencies in our internal  support functions. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue may  vary \nfrom period to period as a percentage of revenue due to the variability of legal and regulatory-related expenses. \nDepreciation and Amortization \nDepreciation and amortization expenses prim arily consist of depreciation on buildings, site improvements, computer and network \nequipment, software, leasehold improvement s, furniture and fixtures, and amortizati on of intangible assets. Depreciation includ es \nexpenses associated with buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, and furniture, fixtures, as well as leas ehold \nimprovements. Amortization includes expenses associated with our capitalized internal-use software and acquired intangible assets. ",
          " \n52 \nInterest Expense \nInterest expense consists primarily of interest expense asso ciated with our outstanding debt , including amortization of debt \ndiscount and issuance costs. For additiona l detail related to our debt  obligations, see “Note 8 – Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit \nArrangements” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Dat a,” \nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nOther Income (Expense), Net \nOther income (expense), net primarily includes the following items: \n• Interest income, which consists primarily  of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents, short- term investments, \nrestricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted investments. \n• Foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net, which consist prim arily of remeasurement of transactions and monetary assets \nand liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency at the end of the period. \n• Gain on business divestitures, net. \n• Gain (loss) from sale of investments. \n• Unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, net, which consists primarily of gains (losses) from fair value \nadjustments relating to our marketable and non-marketable securities. \n• Impairment of equity method investment. \n• Revaluation of MLU B.V . call option, which represents changes in fair value recorded on the call option granted to Yandex \n(“MLU B.V . Call Option”). \n• Acquisition termination fee. \n• Other, net. \nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes \nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in  which we do business. These foreign jurisdictions \nhave different statutory tax rates than those in the United Stat es. Additionally, certain of our fo reign earnings may also be t axable in \nthe United States. Acco rdingly, our effective tax rate will vary depending on the relative pr oportion of foreign to domestic in come, \nchanges in the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, and changes in tax laws. \nThe income tax benefit was $5.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes a $6.4 billion benefit related to the \nrelease of our valuation allowance on the U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, with the exception of our California R&D credits \nand other non-material deferred tax assets.  \nWe regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. In making that assessment, we consider \nboth positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realiz ation of the deferred tax assets to determine, based on the weight \nof all available evidence, whether it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.  \nAs of December 31, 2024, we demonstrated sustained profitability in the U.S. based on U. S. pre-tax book income adjusted for \npermanent book-to-tax differences. Further, given our taxable income position for the annual pe riod ended on December 31, 2024,  we \nutilized more attributes than we generated,  which reduces our U.S. federal and state net deferred tax assets. This information is both \nobjective and verifiable; thereby, representing strong positive evidence that carries significant weight. \nBased on all available positive and negativ e evidence, including the objective and ve rifiable positive evidence as described ab ove \nand anticipated future earnings, we concluded it is more-likely-than-not that a majority of our U.S. federal and state deferred\n tax assets \nwill be realizable. We continue to maintain  a valuation allowance against the California R&D credits, as we believe it is not m ore-\nlikely-than-not to be realized, as we expect R&D tax credit generation to exceed our ability to use these credits in future periods. \nFurthermore, based on available evidence, we believe it is more-l ikely-than-not that the Netherla nds’ net deferred tax assets will \nnot be fully realizable. We will continue to maintain a valuation allowance against th ese net deferred tax assets. We regularly  review \nthe deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected ti ming of \nthe reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies by jurisdiction. \nBased on our assessment of current income a nd anticipated future earnings , there is a reasonable possibility that we will have \nsufficient evidence to release a significant portion of the valua tion allowance in the Netherlands within the next 12 months. H owever, \nour judgment regarding future earnings and the exact timing and amount of any valuation allowance release is subject to change due to \nmany factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our bus iness plans and/or tax planning  \nstrategies. Release of the valuation allowance would result in th e recognition of net deferred tax assets on our consolidated b alance \nsheet and would result in an income tax benefit in the period the release is recorded.

          " \n53 \nThe Inflation Reduction Act Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (“CAMT”), which is a minimum tax calculated by reference to \nfinancial statement income, does not apply to the Company for the year ended December 31, 2024. We could be subject to the CAMT  \nin future years, which would require us to make minimum cash tax payments. \nIn addition, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Deve lopment has led international efforts among approximately 140 \ncountries and taxing jurisdictions to propos e and implement changes to numerous long- standing tax principles, including a frame work \nthat imposes a minimum tax rate of 15% in each taxing jurisdiction. Under this guidance, we will be required to determine a com bined \neffective tax rate for all entities located in a jurisdiction. If the jurisdictional effective tax rate determined under these rules is less than \n15%, a top-up tax will be due to bring the jurisdictional effective tax rate up to 15%.  We are continuing to monitor the pendin g \nimplementation of these rules by individual countries and the potential impact on our business. The provision effective in 2024  had an \ninsignificant impact on our tax obligations for 2024.  \nIncome (Loss) from Equity Method Investments \nIncome (loss) from equity method investme nts primarily includes the results of our share of income or loss from our equity \nmethod investments.

MAPCs is the number of unique consumers who completed a Mobility ride or received a \nDelivery order on our platform at least once in a given month, averaged over each month in the quarter. While a unique consumer  can \nuse multiple product offerings on our platform in a given month, that unique consumer is counted as only one MAPC. We use MAPCs \nto assess the adoption of our platform and frequency of transact ions, which are key factors in our penetration of the countries  in which \nwe operate. \n \n \nTrips. We define Trips as the number of comp leted consumer Mobility rides and Delivery orders in a given period. For example, \nan UberX Share ride with three paying consumers represents three unique Trips, whereas an UberX ride with three passengers \nrepresents one Trip. We believe that Trips are a useful metric to measure the scale and usage of our platform. \n \n",
          " \n60 \nGross Bookings. We define Gross Bookings as the total dollar value, including any applicable taxes, tolls, and fees, of: Mobility \nrides, Delivery orders (in each case withou t any adjustment for consumer discounts and refunds, Driver and Merchant earnings, a nd \nDriver incentives) and Freight revenue. Gross Bookings do not include tips earned by Drivers. Gross Bookings are an indication of the \nscale of our current platform, which ultimately impacts revenue.  \n \n(In millions)  Q1 2023  Q2 2023  Q3 2023  Q4 2023  Q1 2024  Q2 2024  Q3 2024  Q4 2024 \nMobility  $ 14,981   $ 16,728   $ 17,903   $ 19,285   $ 18,670   $ 20,554   $ 21,002   $ 22,798  \nDelivery   15,026    15,595    16,094    17,011    17,699    18,126    18,663    20,126  \nFreight   1,401    1,278    1,284    1,279    1,282    1,272    1,308    1,273  \nAdjusted EBITDA.

In addit ion \nto revenue, net income (loss), income (los s) from operations, and other results under GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA, revenue \ngrowth rates in constant currency and free cash flow, which are described below, to evaluate our business. We use these non-GAA P \nfinancial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe \nthat these non-GAAP financial me asures provide meaningful supp lemental informatio n regarding our performance by excluding \ncertain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results. \nWe believe that both management  and investors benefit from re ferring to these non-GAAP financ ial measures in assessing our \nperformance and when planning, fo recasting, and analyzing future  periods. These non-GAAP financia l measures also facilitate \nmanagement’s internal co mparisons to our historic al performance. We believe these non-GAAP  financial measures are useful to \ninvestors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and \noperational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institu tional investors and the analyst co mmunity to help them analyze  the \nhealth of our business. Accordingly, we be lieve that these non-GAAP financial measures prov ide useful information to investors and \nothers in understanding and evaluating our operating results in th e same manner as our management team and board of directors. Our \ncalculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ  from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures, if any, reported by our pe er \ncompanies. These non-GAAP financial measures  should not be considered  in isolation from, or as  substitutes for, financial \ninformation prepared in accordance with GAAP. \n",

Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBIT DA provides useful information to investors and others in \nunderstanding and evaluating our operating results in the sa me manner as our management team and board of directors. In addition, it \nprovides a useful measure for period-to-per iod comparisons of our business, as it re moves the effect of certain non-cash expens es and \ncertain variable charges. \nLegal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements \nLegal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements are primarily related to certain significant legal proceedings or \ngovernmental investigations  related to worker cla ssification definitions, or tax agencies challenging our non-income tax positi ons. \nThese matters have limited precedent, cover extended historical periods and are unpredictable in both magnitude and timing, therefore \nare distinct from normal, recurring legal, tax and regulator y matters and related expenses incurred in our ongoing operating \nperformance.\n \nLimitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation \nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, should be  considered as supplemental in nature, and is not meant as a \nsubstitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These limitations include the following: \n• Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain recurring, non-cash charge s, such as depreciation of property and equipment and \namortization of intangible assets, and a lthough these are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may \nhave to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect all cash capital expenditure requirements for such \nreplacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; \n• Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, wh ich has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable \nfuture, a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of our compensation strategy; \n• Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain restructuring and related charges, part of which may be settled in cash; \n• Adjusted EBITDA excludes other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance; \n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect period-to-period changes in taxes, income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay \nincome taxes; \n• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the components of other income (expense), net, which primarily includes: interest income; \nforeign currency exchange gains (losses), net; gain (loss) on business divestitures,  net; unrealized gain (loss) on debt and \nequity securities, net; and impairment of debt and equity securities; and \n• Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements that may reduce cash available \nto us.

The increase in cash \nfrom working capital was primarily driven by an increase in our accrued insurance reserves primarily due to liabilities recorded during \nthe period exceeding claims paid out, and accrued expenses and ot her liabilities, partially offset by an increase in accounts r eceivable \nand prepaid expenses and other assets primarily due to tax matter s recorded as a receivable in other assets described in the No n-\nIncome Tax Matters section below. \nNet cash provided by operating activities was $3.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023,  primarily consisting of $2.2 \nbillion of net income including non-controlling interests, adjusted for certain non-cash items, which primarily included $1.9 b illion of \nstock-based compensation expense, $1.6 bi llion of unrealized gains from equity secu rities, $823 million of depreciation and \namortization expense, $204 million gain from bus iness divestiture, as well as a $165 mill ion increase in cash from working capi tal. \nThe increase in cash from working capital was primarily driven by an increase in our insurance reserves, partially offset by an  increase \nin prepaid expenses and other assets as well as accounts receivable.

The timing, manner, pric e and amount of any repurchases are determined by the discretio n \nof management, depending on market conditions and other factor s. Repurchases may be made through open market purchases and \naccelerated share repurchases. The exact number of shares to be repurchased by us, if any, is not guaranteed. Depending on mark et \nconditions and other factors, these repurchases may be commenced  or suspended at any time or periodically without prior notice.

Uber UK is remitt ing V AT under the Value Added (Tour Operators) Order 1987 (“V AT \nOrder 1987”), which allows for V AT remittance on a calculated margin, rather than on Gross Bookings.  \nAs of December 31, 2024, we have receive d multiple assessments from the HMRC dispu ting our application of V AT Order 1987 \nfor the period of March 2022 to June 2024, totaling appr oximately $1.6 billion (£1.3 billion) for unpaid V AT. Uber paid the \nassessments in order to proceed with the appeal process. The payments do not represent our acceptance of the assessments.  \nThe payments made in 2023 and 2024 are record ed as a receivable in other assets on our  consolidated balance sheet because we \nbelieve that we will be successful in our appeal, upon which, the full amount of our paym ents will be returned to us with interest upon \ncompletion of the appeals process. We expect to receive additiona l assessments related to this matter and will be required to p ay the \nassessments in order to continue with the appeals process. Any payments are expected to decrease operating cash flow and have n o \nimpact on our results of operations. We plan to vigorously defe nd our application of the V AT Order 1987 and are waiting to obta in \nhearing dates from the Tax Tribunal.

The non-cancellable commitments have varying expiration terms through November \n2029. \nCritical Accounting Estimates \nWe believe that the following accounting policies involve a hi gh degree of judgment and complexity and are critical to \nunderstanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of our operations. An accounting policy is considered to \nbe critical if it requires judgment on a significant accounting es timate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are  \nuncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different esti mates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the \naccounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, \nrevenue and expenses, and related disclosures in our audited consolidated financial statements. We have based our estimates on \nhistorical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which \nform the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. \nAlthough we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due  to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimate s, \nactual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates. \nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies refl ect the more significant judgments, estimates and assumptions us ed \nin the preparation of our consolidated fi nancial statements. For additio nal information, see the disclosure included in Note 1 – \nDescription of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included \nin Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nRevenue Recognition \nWe derive our revenue from service fees paid by Drivers and Me rchants for the use of our platform in connection with our \nMobility products and Delivery of fering provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users. Our so le performance ob ligation in the \ntransaction is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-users to  facilitate the completion of a successful ridesharing trip or  delivery. \nIn many of our markets, we also generate revenue from end-users a nd charge a direct fee for use of the platform or in exchange for \nMobility or Delivery services. \nJudgment is required in evaluating the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we control the service \nprovided to the end-user and are the principa l in the transaction (gross), or we arra nge for other parties to provide the servi ce to the \nend-user and are the agent in the transaction (net). The assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent in a \ntransaction could impact the accounting for certain payments a nd incentives provided to Drivers and end-users and change the am ount \nof revenue recognized. \nEnd-User Discounts and Promotions \nWe offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not customers) to encourage use of our platform. Judgment is required to \ndetermine the appropriate classification of these incentives. End- user discounts and promotions are recorded to sales and marke ting \nexpenses with the exception of market-wide promotions which are recorded as a reduction of revenue. \nBusiness Combinations \nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the ta ngible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible asset s \nacquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fa ir value of purchase considera tion over the fair values of t hese \nidentifiable assets and liab ilities is recorded as goodwill. Such  valuations require ma nagement to make si gnificant estimates a nd \nassumptions, especially with re spect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, \nbut are not \nlimited to, future expected cash flows from acquired advertiser, fleet, merchant, and end-user contracts, acquired technology, and trade \nnames, based on expected future growth rates and margins, attr ition rates, future changes in technology and royalty for similar  brand \nlicenses, useful lives, and discount rates. \nManagement's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain \nand unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifia ble assets \nand liabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life , whereas \nany indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, ar e not amortized. During the measur ement period, which may be up t o one \nyear from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to th e assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the correspondin g offset \nto goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. \nInvestments—Non-Marketable Equity and Debt Securities \nWe hold investments in privately held companies in the form of equity securities and debt securities without readily determinable \nfair values and in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence. Investments in equity securities witho ut readily \ndeterminable fair values are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently adjusted to fair value for impairments and price c hanges ",
          " \n66 \nfrom observable transactions in the same or a similar security from the same issuer. Investments in material available-for-sale  debt \nsecurities are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date with the chang es in fair \nvalue recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of ta x. We may elect the fair value option for financial instruments  and \naccount for investments in debt and equity se curities at fair value with changes repor ted in net income (loss) from continuing \noperations. \nInvestments in privately held equity and debt securities are valued using significan t unobservable inputs or data in inactive \nmarkets. This valuation requires judgment due to the absence of ma rket prices and inherent lack of liquidity and are classified  as \nLevel 3 in the fair value hierarchy. In determining the estimate d fair value of our investments in privately held companies, we  utilize \nthe most recent data available including observed transactions such  as equity financing transacti ons of the investees and sales  of the \nexisting shares of the investees’ securities. In addition, the de termination of whether an observed transaction is similar to t he equity \nand debt securities held by us requires significant management judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities. \nWe assess our investment portfolio of privately held equity and debt securitie s quarterly for impairment. The impairment analys is \nfor investments in equity securities includes a qualitative anal ysis of factors including the investee’s financial performance,  industry \nand market conditions, and other relevant factors. If an equity i nvestment is considered to be impaired we will establish a new  \ncarrying value for the investment and rec ognize an impairment loss through our conso lidated statement of operations. Investment s in \ndebt securities are evaluated for impairme nt quarterly based on whether its fair value has declined below its amortized cost. I n \ncircumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell the security before it recovers its amortiz ed cost \nbasis, the difference between the fair valu e and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated financial statement  of \noperations, with a corresponding write-down of the security’s amortized cost. In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then \nevaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists  can \ninclude the extent to which fair value is  less than the amor tized cost basis, ch anges in the credit quality of the underlying l oan \nobligor’s, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit -related, we \ncompare the present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the security’s effective interest rate to the amortized \ncost basis of the security. A credit-related impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and  \nrecognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to net income (los s). \nAny remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. \nImprovements in expected cash flows due to improvements in cr edit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and \ncorresponding reduction in the allowance for credit loss. \nEquity Method Investments \nWe account for investments in the common st ock or in-substance common st ock of entities that provi de us with the ability to \nexercise significant influence, but not a controlling financial in terest, using the equity method. Investments accounted for un der the \nequity method are initially recorded at cost. Subsequently, we  recognize through the consolidated  statements of operations, and  as an \nadjustment to the investment balance, our proportionate share of the investee entities’ net income or loss, and the amortization of basis \ndifferences. In accounting for these investment s, we record our share of the entities’ net income or loss one quarter in arrear s. Equity \nmethod investments for which the fair value option is elected are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in f\nair value \nreflected in earnings. \nWe review our equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the \ncarrying value of the investment may not be fully recoverable.  Qualitative and quantitative factors considered as indicators of  a \npotential impairment include financial results and operating trends of the investees, implied values in transactions of the inv estee’s \nsecurities, severity and length of decline in value, and our in tention for holding the investment, among other factors. If an i mpairment \nis determined to be other-than-temporary, the fair value of the impaired investment would have to be determined and an impairme nt \ncharge recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the investment. The fair value determinatio n, \nparticularly for investments in privately held companies, requi res significant judgment to determine appropriate estimates and \nassumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could affe ct the calculation of the fair value of the investments and t he \ndetermination of the impairment charges. \nGoodwill Impairment Assessment \nWe review goodwill for impairment annually (i n the fourth quarter) and wh enever events or changes in circumstances indicate \nthat goodwill might be impaired. We make cer tain judgments and assumptions to determ ine our reporting units and in allocating \nshared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. Determination of reporting unit s is based \non a judgmental evaluation of the level at which our segment mana gers review financial results, evaluate performance, and alloc ate \nresources. \nJudgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairme nt include, among other factors:  financial performance; legal, \nregulatory, contractual, politic al, business, and other factors;  entity specific factors; industry and ma rket considerations, \nmacroeconomic conditions, a nd other relevant events and factor s affecting the reporting unit. To the extent we determine that i t is \nmore likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed. ",
          " \n67 \nPerforming a quantitative goodwill impa irment test includes the dete rmination of the fair value of a reporting unit and involve s \nsignificant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assu mptions include, among others, revenue growth rates and operatin g \nmargins used to calculate projec ted future cash flows, risk-adj usted discount rates, future ec onomic and market conditions, and  the \ndetermination of appropriate market comparables. \nLoss Contingencies \nWe are involved in legal proceedings, cl aims, and regulatory, indirect tax exam inations, or governme nt inquiries and \ninvestigations that may arise in the ordina ry course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for subst antial or \nindeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the \namount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be rea sonably \nestimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. \nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could af fect the amount of the provisions  that have been previously \nrecorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses di sclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes t o our \ndisclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated infor mation. \nSignificant judgment is required to determin e both the probability and the estimated amo unt of loss. These estimates have been based \non our assessment of the facts and circumst ances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based on new information and \nfuture events. \nThe outcomes of litigation, regulatory, indi rect tax examinations and investigations are inherently uncertain. Therefore, if on e or \nmore of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in  excess of management’s expectat ions, our results of operations, \nfinancial condition, or cash flows, incl uding in a particular reporting period in wh ich any such outcome becomes probable and \nestimable, could be materially adversely affected. \nIncome Taxes \nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and forei gn jurisdictions. We account for income taxes using the asset and \nliability method. The establishment of deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers of intangible assets requires management  to make \nsignificant estimates and assumptions to dete rmine the fair value of such intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing i ntangible \nassets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue and expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intan gible \nassets, comparable transaction values, and/or discount rates. Th e discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to  present \nvalue are derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow. \nAlthough we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical \nexperience, internal and external comparable data and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occu r \nthat could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. \nWe account for uncertainty in tax positions  by recognizing a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more-likely-th an-\nnot that the position will be sustained upon examination. Evaluating our uncertain ta x positions and dete rmining our provision for \nincome taxes are inherently uncertain and require making judg ments, assumptions, and estimates. While we believe we have \nadequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will  not be \ndifferent. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. To the extent that the \nfinal tax outcome of these matters is different than the amount s recorded, such differences may impact the provision for income  taxes \nand the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made. \nThe provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the related net int erest \nand penalties. In addition, we ar e subject to the continuous exam ination of our income tax retu rns by the IRS and other tax aut horities \nwhich may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinatio ns \nand assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. \nThe income tax benefit was $5.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes a $6.4 billion benefit related to the \nrelease of our valuation allowance on the U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, with the exception of our California R&D credits \nand other non-material deferred tax assets. \nWe regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. In making that assessment, we consider \nboth positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realiz ation of the deferred tax assets to determine, based on the weight \nof all available evidence, whether it is more-likely-than -not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.  \nAs of December 31, 2024, we demonstrated sustained profitability in the U.S. based on U. S. pre-tax book income adjusted for \npermanent book-to-tax differences. Further, given our taxable income position for the annual pe riod ended on December 31, 2024,  we \nutilized more attributes than we generated,  which reduces our U.S. federal and state net deferred tax assets. This information is both \nobjective and verifiable; thereby, representing strong positive evidence that carries significant weight.  \nBased on all available positive and negativ e evidence, including the objective and ve rifiable positive evidence as described ab ove \nand anticipated future earnings, we concluded it is more-likely-than-not that a majority of our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets ",
          " \n68 \nwill be realizable. We continue to maintain  a valuation allowance against the California R&D credits, as we believe it is not m ore-\nlikely-than-not to be realized, as we expect R&D tax credit generation to exceed our ability to use these credits in future periods. \nFurthermore, based on available evidence, we believe it is more-l ikely-than-not that the Netherla nds’ net deferred tax assets will \nnot be fully realizable. We will continue to maintain a valuation allowance against th ese net deferred tax assets. We regularly  review \nthe deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected ti ming of \nthe reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies by jurisdiction. \nBased on our assessment of current income a nd anticipated future earnings , there is a reasonable possibility that we will have \nsufficient evidence to release a significant portion of the valua tion allowance in the Netherlands within the next 12 months. H owever, \nour judgment regarding future earnings and the exact timing and amount of any valuation allowance release is subject to change due to \nmany factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our bus iness plans and/or tax planning  \nstrategies. Release of the valuation allowance would result in th e recognition of net deferred tax assets on our consolidated b alance \nsheet and would result in an income tax benefit in the period the release is recorded. \nInsurance Reserves \nWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance \nsubsidiary, to provide for the potential li abilities for certain risks, including au to liability, uninsured and underinsured mo torist, auto \nphysical damage, general liability, and workers’ compensation. Insurance reserves is an estimate  of our potential liability for  unpaid \nlosses and loss adjustment expens es, which represents the estima te of the ultimate unpaid obliga tion for such insurance related  risks \nand includes an amount for case reserves related to reported clai ms and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of th e \nbalance sheet date. The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligati on utilizes generally accepted ac tuarial methods applied to his torical \nclaim and loss experience. In addition, we use assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns \nand expected loss costs, which consider frequency trends, severi ty trends, and relevant industry data. These reserves are conti nually \nreviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known. Adjustments to reserves retained by us, if any,  \nrelating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations. \nAll estimates of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserv es, are subject to inherent \nvariability caused by the nature of the insurance claim settlement  process. Such variability is increased for us due to limited  historical \nexperience and the nature of the coverage provided. Actual resu lts depend upon the outcome of future contingent events and can be \naffected by many factors, such as claim se ttlement processes and changes in the econom ic, legal, and social environments. As a result, \nthe net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability, and when these amounts will be paid, may vary in the near term from \nthe estimated amounts. \nWhile management believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less th an, \nthe amount provided. \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements  \nSee Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements \nincluded in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK \nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily in clude interest rate risk, invest ment \nrisk, and foreign currency risk as follows: \nInterest Rate Risk \nAs of June 30, 2024, we had approximately $1.97 billion in aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 2030 Refinanced Term \nLoans, which were floating rate notes carried at amortized cost and subject to interest rate risk. In September 2024, we fully repaid all \nloans outstanding under this term loan agreement. As a result, our  primary exposure to market risks for changes in interest rat es relate \nprimarily to the new Credit Agr eement of which we currently have no drawn am ounts as of December 31,  2024. For additional \ninformation, see Note 8 – Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit Arra ngements in the notes to the consolidated financial statement s \nincluded in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nThe fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of inte rest rates, increasing in periods of decl ining \nrates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest  rates would \nhave decreased the fair value of our notes by $461 million as of December 31, 2024. \nInvestment Risk  \nOur investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution or commercial issuer. Cash deposits \ntypically exceed insured limits and are placed with financial in stitutions around the world that we believe are of high credit quality. \nThese deposits are in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance limits. There can be no assurance that \nour deposits in excess of the FDIC limits will be backstopped by th e U.S., or that any bank or financial institution with which  we do ",
          " \n69 \nbusiness will be able to obtain needed liquidity from other ba nks, government institutions or by acquisition in the event of a failure or \nliquidity crisis. \nOur investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and m eet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. We \nhad cash and cash equivalents in cluding restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.0 billion and $8. 6 billion as of Decem ber 31, \n2023 and December 31, 2024, respectively. Marketab le debt securities classified as restricted investments and short-term investments \ntotaled $8.1 billion as of December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securiti es \nprimarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. gove rnment securities, U.S. government agency securities, and \ninvestment-grade corporate debt securities . We do not enter into investments for tr ading or speculative purposes. Investments i n fixed \nrate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Changes in  rates would primarily impact in terest income due to the relati vely short-\nterm nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point ch ange in interest rates would not have a material effect on our  \nfinancial results. \nWe are exposed to certain risks related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, \nprivately-held entities and public  companies, compared to  their fair value. We hold privat ely held investments in illiquid priv ate \ncompany stock which are inherently difficult to value given the la ck of publicly available information. We also hold equity sec urities \nwith readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk. These investments in privately-held entities and public \ncompanies may increase the volatil ity in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes in the fair value of these inve stments. \nIn certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a  set period \nof time after a public offering. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of these investments was $8.8 billion, including e quity \nmethod investments. \nForeign Currency Risk \nWe transact business globally in multiple cu rrencies. Our international revenue, as well  as costs and expenses denominated in \nforeign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in fore ign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are ex posed to \nforeign currency risks related to our revenue and operating e xpenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. \nAccordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our  future revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S . \ndollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is diversified \nacross geographic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions. \nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/( loss) as a result of transaction gains or \n(losses) related to remeasurement of our asset and liability bala nces that are denominated in currencies other than the functio nal \ncurrency of the entities in whic h they are recorded. We enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to mitigate the foreig n \nexchange risk associated with assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our functional currency. While these contracts \nhelp reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, they do not fully eliminate this risk. ",

          " \n71 \nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Uber Technologies, Inc. \nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting \nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Uber Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statemen ts of operations, of comprehensive income (loss), of redeemabl e \nnon-controlling interests and equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the \nrelated notes and financial statement schedule listed in the acco mpanying index (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial \nstatements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on cr iteria \nestablished in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of S ponsoring Organizations of the Treadway \nCommission (COSO). \nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to  above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial  position of \nthe Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023,  and the results of its opera tions and its cash flows fo r each of the three years in the \nperiod ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting princi ples generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in \nour opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal c ontrol over financial reporting as of Decemb er 31, \n2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. \nBasis for Opinions \nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintain ing effective internal control over \nfinancial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Mana gement’s \nReport on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing unde r Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the \nCompany’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company' s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.  We \nare a public accounting firm registered wi th the Public Company Accounting Oversight  Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are \nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable r ules \nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the aud its \nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated fina ncial statements are free of material misstatement, whether d ue to \nerror or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement  of the \nconsolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,  and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such \nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence rega rding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial \nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting pr inciples used and significant estimates made by management, as  well \nas evaluating the overall presentation of th e consolidated financial statements. Our a udit of internal control over financial r eporting \nincluded obtaining an understanding of internal control over financ ial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness e xists, and \ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of in ternal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also i ncluded \nperforming such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonab le \nbasis for our opinions. \nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n \nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the relia bility of \nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted acc ounting \nprinciples. A company’s internal control over financial reporti ng includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to th e \nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately a nd fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the asset s of the \ncompany; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in \naccordance with generally accepted  accounting principles, and that  receipts and expenditures of th e company are being made only  in \naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding \nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect \non the financial statements. \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, p rojections \nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to  the risk that controls may become inadequate because of cha nges in \nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \nCritical Audit Matters\n \nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial \nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicat ed to the audit committee and th at (i) relate to accounts or \ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated financial st atements and (ii) involved our es pecially challenging, subjective , or \ncomplex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters doe s not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financ ial ",
          " \n72 \nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on  the \ncritical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \nPresentation of Mobility and Deli very Revenue Agreements, Incl uding Incentives, Discounts and Promo tions to Drivers, Merchants \nand End-Users \nAs described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company derives its revenues from Drivers’ and \nMerchants’ use of the Company’s platform, on-demand lead generation, and related services in connection with Mobility and Deliv ery \nservices, as well as from direct fees charged to end-users for us e of the platform or in excha nge for Mobility or Delivery serv ices. \nManagement applies judgment in determining whether the Company is the principal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchant s \nand end-users. This determination impacts the presentation of revenue on a gross or ne t basis as well as the presentation of in centives \nprovided to Drivers and Merchants and discount s and promotions offered to end-users, to the extent they are not customers. For the \nyear ended December 31, 2024, the Company’s Mobility and Delivery revenue was $38.8 billion and consumer discounts, promotions, \ncredits and refunds provided to end-users who are not customers totaled $1.4 billion, of which a significant portion relates to discounts \nand promotions. \nThe principal considerations for our determ ination that performing proc edures relating to the presentation of Mobility and Deli very \nrevenue agreements, including incentives, discounts and promotions to  Drivers, Merchants, and end-users is a critical audit mat ter are \nthe significant judgment by management in assessing the presentation of revenue on a gr oss or net basis, as well as the present ation of \nincentives, discounts and promotions offered to Drivers, Merchants,  and end-users, which in turn led to a high degree of audito r \njudgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to whether transaction attrib utes \nwere appropriately analyzed and presented by management. \nAddressing the matter involved performing pr ocedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opini on \non the consolidated financial statements. These procedures include d testing the effectiveness of controls related to the Compan y’s \nrevenue recognition process, in cluding controls over the presen tation of Mobility and Delivery revenue, incentives, discounts a nd \npromotions. These procedures also included, among others, testing, on a sample basis, trip transaction attributes and assessing  \nmanagement’s classification of new or chan ged agreements by examining documentation of the agreement terms, trip receipts, and \nother support, and assessing the impact of  those terms and attributes on the presen tation of revenue and income statement \nclassification. \nValuation of Insurance Reserves \nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements , insurance reserves is an estimate of the liability for unpaid losses and \nloss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for ce rtain insurance related risks, including \nauto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical  damage, general liability, and workers’ compensation, and in cludes \nan amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of the balance she et date. \nThe estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligati on utilizes generally accepted  actuarial methods applied to historical  claim and lo ss \nexperience. In addition, management uses assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and \nexpected loss costs, which consider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data. These reserves are continual ly \nreviewed by management and adjusted as experience develops a nd new information becomes known. The Company’s short-term and \nlong-term insurance reserves as of December 31, 2024 totaled $9.8 billion. \nThe principal considerations for our determ ination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves i s a \ncritical audit matter are the significant judgment by management  when developing the estimate of the insurance reserves, which in \nturn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures  and evaluating audit evidence r elating \nto the actuarial methods and management’s significant assumptions  related to loss development patterns and expected loss costs.  The \naudit effort also involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \nAddressing the matter involved performing pr ocedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opini on \non the consolidated financial statements. These procedures include d testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Compa ny’s \nvaluation of insurance reserves, including controls over the devel opment of the significant assumptions related to loss develop ment \npatterns and expected loss costs. These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill \nand knowledge to assist in (i) developing, for selected reserv e components, an independent actuarial estimate of the insurance \nreserves, and comparison of this independent estimate to manageme nt’s actuarially determined reserves, and (ii) testing, for ot her \nselected reserve components, management’s process for estimati ng the insurance reserves. Developing the independent estimate \ninvolved independently developing the loss development patterns a nd expected loss costs and testing the completeness and accura cy \nof data provided by management. Testing ma nagement’s process for estimating the insurance reserves involved evaluating the \nappropriateness of management’s actuar ial methods, evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by \nmanagement related to loss development patterns and expected loss  costs used in those methods, and testing the completeness and  \naccuracy of data used by management. \n \n ",

          " \n82 \nUBER TECHNOLOGIES, INC.  \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \nNote 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  \nDescription of Business \nUber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is \nheadquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is a technol ogy platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, \noperational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. Uber deve lops and operates proprietary \ntechnology applications supporting a variety of  offerings on its platform (“platform(s)” or “Platform(s)”). Uber connects consu mers \n(“Rider(s)”) with independent providers of ride services (“Mobility Driver(s)”) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other \nconsumers (“Eaters”) with restaurants, grocers and other stores  (collectively, “Merchants”) with delivery service providers \n(“Couriers”) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as “end- user(s)” \nor “consumer(s).” Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as “Driver(s).” Uber also connects consumers with public \ntransportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shipp ers \n(“Shippers”) with carriers (“Carriers”) in the freight indus try. The foundation of our platform is this network of Drivers, Cou riers, \nMerchants, Carriers as well as Riders, Eaters and Shippers (col lectively “Platform Participant(s)”). We define Platform Earner( s) as \nDrivers, Couriers and Merchants as well as Carriers. Uber is also developing technologies designed to provide new solutions to solve \neveryday problems. \nOur technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada, Latin America, Europe (excluding \nRussia), the Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific (“APAC”, excluding China and Southeast Asia). \nFoodpanda Taiwan \nIn May 2024, we entered into a definitiv e agreement with Delivery He ro SE (“Delivery Hero”) to acquire 100% ownership \ninterest in Delivery Hero’s Foodpanda delivery business in Taiwan (“Foodpanda Taiwan”) for approximately $950 million in cash, on \na cash and debt free basis, subject to certain adjustments. In January 2025, the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission issued a decision  \nprohibiting the transaction. If we do not appeal the Taiwan Fair  Trade Commission’s decision, we expect to pay a termination fe e \nduring the first half of 2025. We expect the termination fee to be  settled in either (i) cash or (ii) by returning our initial investment in \nordinary shares of Delivery Hero (which Delivery Hero has the option to accept, or alternatively request equivalent cash), and,  as of \nDecember 31, 2024, we recorded an expense of $236 million in ot her income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of \noperations. Refer to Note 3 – Investments and Fair Value Measurement for further details on the Delivery Hero investment. \nBasis of Presentation \nThe accompanying consolidated fi nancial statements have been  prepared in accord ance with generally accepted accounting \nprinciples in the United States (“GAAP”). We consolidate our wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned subsidiaries over which \nwe exercise control, and variable interest entities (“VIEs”) where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Refer to Note 1 5 – \nVariable Interest Entities for further information. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. \nPrior period amounts on the consolidated balance sheet, and notes th ereto, have been reclassified to conform to the current per iod \npresentation. Certain insurance reserves in accrued and other current liabilities and other l ong-term liabilities were reclassi fied to \nshort-term and long-term insurance reserves, respectively. Deferre d tax assets, previously presented within other assets, were \nreclassified to be presented separately on our consolidated balance sheet. These recl assifications had no impact on our previou sly \nreported total assets, total liabilities, results of operations, co mprehensive income or net cash  flows from operating, financi ng or \ninvesting activities. \nUse of Estimates \nThe preparation of our consolidat ed financial statements in c onformity with GAAP requires mana gement to make estimates and \nassumptions, which affect the reported amount s in the financial statements and accomp anying notes. Estimates are based on histo rical \nexperience, where applicable, and other assumptions which manage ment believes are reasonable under the circumstances. On an \nongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not  limited to: fair values of investments and other financial \ninstruments (including the measurement of cr edit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair val ue of \nacquired intangible assets and related impairment as sessments; impairment of goodwill; stock- based compensation; income taxes a nd \nnon-income tax reserves; certain deferred tax assets a nd tax liabilities; insura nce reserves; and other contingent liabilities.  These \nestimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates. ",
          " \n83 \nConcentration of Credit Risk \nCash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, restricted investments, other receivab les, \nand accounts receivable are potentially subject to credit risk c oncentration. Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale se curities \nprimarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. gove rnment and agency securities, a nd investment-grade corporate d ebt \nsecurities. Our investment policy limits th e amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution or commercial issuer.  Cash \ndeposits typically exceed insured limits and are placed with financial institutions around the world that we believe are of hig h credit \nquality. We have not experienced any material losses related to these concentrations during the periods presented. We rely on t hird \nparties to provide payment processing services (“payment service providers”) to collect amounts due from end-users. Payment ser vice \nproviders are financial institutions or credit card companies that we believe are of high credit quality. No customers accounted for 10% \nor more of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024. \nCash and Cash Equivalents \nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash held in checking and savings accounts as well as investments in money market funds, \nU.S. government and agency securities, commercial paper, co rporate bonds, and time deposits. We consider all highly-liquid \ninvestments purchased with an original or re maining maturity of three months or less at  the date of purchase to be cash equival ents. \nCash includes amounts collected on behalf of, but not yet remitted to Drivers and Merc hants, which are included in accrued and other \ncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. \nRestricted Cash and Cash Equivalents  \nRestricted cash and cash equivalents are pledged as security for letters of credit or other collateral amounts established by us for \ncertain insurance policies and also include cash and cash equivalents that are unavailable for immediate use due to legal and/or \ncontractual restrictions. Restricted cash and cash equivalents are classified as current and non-current assets based on the contractual \nor estimated term of the remaining restriction. The reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents \nto amounts presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows are as follows (in millions): \n  As of December 31, \n  2022  2023  2024 \nCash and cash equivalents  $ 4,208   $ 4,680   $ 5,893  \nRestricted cash and cash equivalents - current   680    805    545  \nRestricted cash and cash equivalents - non-current   1,789    1,519    2,172  \nTotal cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents  $ 6,677   $ 7,004   $ 8,610  \nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts \nAccounts receivable represents: (i) uncollected payments from e nd-users for completed transactions where the payment method is \ncredit card and includes (a) end-user payments not yet settled with payment service providers and (b) end-user payments settled  by \npayment service providers but not yet remitted to us; (ii) co mpleted shipments where we have an unconditional right to the \nconsideration from Freight customers (“Shippers”) and payment has not been received; or (iii) uncollected payments from Uber fo r \nBusiness organizations for completed transactions. The timing of settlement of amounts due from these parties varies by region and by \nproduct. The portion of the receivable to be remitted to Drivers and Merchants is included in accrued and other current liabili ties on \nthe consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 9 – Supplementa l Financial Statement Information for amounts payable to Drivers and \nMerchants. \nAlthough we pre-authorize forms of payment to mitigate our exposur e, we bear the cost of any accounts receivable losses. We \nrecord an allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable that may never settle or be collected, as well as for credit card \nchargebacks including fraudulent credit card transactions. The allowance for doubtful accounts is primarily included as cost of revenue \nin the consolidated statements of operations. We estimate the allowance based on historical experience, estimated future paymen ts and \ngeographical trends, which are reviewed periodically and as need ed, and amounts are written off when determined to be uncollect ible. \nChargebacks and credit card lo sses were $286 million, $245 million and $252 million for the years ended D ecember 31, 2022, 2023  \nand 2024, respectively. ",
          " \n84 \nProperty and Equipment, Net  \nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is \ncomputed using the straight‑line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are as follows: \nProperty and Equipment  Estimated Useful Life \nLand  Indefinite \nBuildings  30-45 years \nSite improvements  5-15 years \nComputer equipment  3-5 years \nFurniture and fixtures  3-5 years \nInternal-use software  2 years \nMotor vehicles and other equipment  3-10 years \nLeased computer equipment  Shorter of estimated useful life or lease term \nLeasehold improvements  Shorter of estimated useful life or lease term \nWhen assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost, accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the \naccounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the cons olidated statements of operations in the period realized. Maint enance \nand repairs that do not enhance or extend the asset’s useful life are charged to operating expenses as incurred. \nWe capitalize certain costs, such as compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, and interest incurred on outstandi ng \ndebt, in developing internal-use software  once planning has been completed, manageme nt has authorized and committed project \nfunding, and it is probable that the project  will be completed and the software will function as intended. Amortization of such  costs \noccurs on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of  the related asset and begins once the asset is ready for its intended use. \nCosts incurred prior to meeting these criteria, together with costs incurred for training and maintenance, are expensed as incu rred. In \naddition, we capitalize interest incurred on outstanding debt during the period of construction-in-progress of certain assets. \nLeases \nWe account for leases in accordance with Accounting Standard s Codification (“ASC”) 842, “Leases” (“ASC 842”). We made a \npolicy election not to separate non-lease components from lease components, therefore, we account for lease and non-lease \ncomponents as a single lease component. We also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify. \nWe determine if a contract contains a lease at inception of the arrangement base d on whether we have the right to obtain \nsubstantially all of the economic benefits from the use of an id entified asset and whether we have the right to direct the use of an \nidentified asset in exchange for consideration, which relates to an asset which we do not own. Right of use (“ROU”) assets repr esent \nour right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from \nthe lease. ROU assets are recognized as the lease liability, adjusted for lease incentives received. Lease liabilities are recognized at the \npresent value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present valu e of the \nfuture lease payments is our incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”), because the interest rate implicit in most of our leases is no t readily \ndeterminable. The IBR is a hypothetical rate based on our unders tanding of what our credit rating would be to borrow and result ing \ninterest we would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease pa yments in a similar economic environment over the lease term on a \ncollateralized basis. Lease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixed payments or in-substance fixed payments are \nincluded in our lease liability calculation. Variable lease payments may include costs such as common area maintenance, utiliti es, real \nestate taxes or other costs. Variable lease payments are recognized in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for those \npayments are incurred. \nOperating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current and operating lease liabilities, non-\ncurrent on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued and other current \nliabilities, and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. For operating leases, lease expense is recognized on a \nstraight-line basis in operations over the lease term. For finance leases, lease expense is recognized as depreciation and interest; \ndepreciation on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest using the effective interest method. \nAcquisitions \nWe account for acquisitions of entities or  asset groups that qualify as businesses in accordance with ASC 805, “Business \nCombinations” (“ASC 805”). The pu rchase price of the acquisition is allocated to the tangible a nd intangible assets acquired an d \nliabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over those f air values \nis recorded as goodwill. During th e measurement period, which may be up to one year from the ac quisition date, we may record \nadjustments to the assets acquired and lia bilities assumed with  the corresponding offset to goo dwill. Upon the conclusion of th e \nmeasurement period or final determination of  the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any \nsubsequent adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. ",
          " \n85 \nGoodwill \nGoodwill represents the excess of  the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a bus iness combination and i s \nallocated to reporting units  expected to benefit from the bus iness combination. We test goodwill for impairment at least annual ly, in \nthe fourth quarter, or whenever events or  changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. We evaluate our \nreporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation \napproach. In testing for goodwill impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to de termine whether the ex istence of events or \ncircumstances leads to a determination that  it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its  carrying \namount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstance s, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a \nreporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then additional impairment testing is not requi red. However, if we conclude otherwise, \nwe proceed to the quantitative assessment. \nThe quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its book value, including goodwill. If the  fair \nvalue exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional st eps are necessary. However, if the book value \nof a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an  impairment loss will be recognized in an  amount equal to that excess, limited to  the total \namount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Refer to Note 7 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets for further information. \nIntangible Assets, Net \nIntangible assets are carried at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range fro m one \nto 18 years. We review definite-lived intangible assets for im pairment under the long-lived asset model described in the Evalua tion of \nLong-Lived Assets for Impairment section. Refer to Note 7 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets for further information. \nInvestments \nEquity Securities \nAccounting for our equity securities vari es depending on the marketability of the se curity and the type of investment. Our \nmarketable equity securities in publicly traded companies are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in the \nconsolidated statements of operations. Ce rtain investments in non-marketable equity  securities are measured at cost, with \nremeasurements to fair value only upon the occurrence of observa ble price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar \nsecurities of the same issuer, or in the event of any impairment. We reassess non-marketable equity securities at each reportin g period \nto determine whether they have a readily de terminable fair value,  in which case they would no longer be eligible for the fair v alue \nmeasurement alternative. Non-marketable equity securities that we elected to apply the fair value option and equity securities with a \nreadily determinable fair value are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recognized in the \nconsolidated statements of operations. We evaluate our non-marketable equity securities for impairment at each reporting period based \non a qualitative assessment that considers various potential impa irment indicators. Impairment indicators might include, but would not \nnecessarily be limited to, a significant dete rioration in the earnings performance, cr edit rating, asset quality, or business p\nrospects of \nthe investee, a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environm ent of the investee, a bona fi de offer \nto purchase, an offer by the investee to sell, or a completed au ction process for the same or si milar securities for an amount less than \nthe carrying amount of the investme nts in those securities. If an impairment exis ts, a loss is recognized in the consolidated s tatements \nof operations for the amount by which the ca rrying value exceeds the fair value of the investment. We include investments in eq uity \nsecurities within investments on the consolidated balance sheets. \nDebt Securities \nAccounting for our debt securities varies depending on the legal form of the security, our intended holding period for the secu rity, \nand the nature of the transaction. Investments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are initially record ed at fair \nvalue. Investments in marketable debt securities may include U. S. government and agency securities, commercial paper, corporate  \nbonds, and time deposits. Subsequent changes in fair value of avai lable-for-sale debt securities are recorded in other comprehe nsive \nincome (loss), net of tax. We record certain of our debt securities at fair value with the changes in fair value recorded in earnings under \nthe fair value option of accounting for financial instruments.  \nAs of December 31, 2024, we considered our marketable debt s ecurities as available for use in current operations, including those \nwith maturity dates beyond one year, and therefore classify these securities as short-term investments on the consolidated bala nce \nsheets. \nAllowance for Credit Losses on Available-for-sale Debt Securities \nWe account for credit losses on available-for-sale debt secur ities in accordance with ASC 326, Financial Instruments - Credit \nLosses (“ASC 326”). Under ASC 326, at each re porting period, we eval uate our available-fo r-sale debt securiti es at the individu al \nsecurity level to determine whether there is a decline in the fair value below its amortized cost basis (an impairment). In circumstances \nwhere we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to  sell, the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis , the \ndifference between fair value and amortize d cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated statements of operations, with a \ncorresponding write-down of the security’s amortized cost. In circumstances where neither condition ex ists, we then evaluate wh ether \na decline is due to credit-related factors. The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to ",
          " \n86 \nwhich fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, change s in the credit quality of the unde rlying loan obligors, credit r atings \nactions, as well as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare the p resent value \nof the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the secu rity’s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security. \nA credit-related impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for \ncredit loss on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to net income (loss). Any remaining decline in fair value \nthat is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive in come (loss), net of tax. Improvements in expected cash flows due to \nimprovements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and corresponding reduction in the allowance for credit loss. \nDerivative Instruments \nWe enter into financial derivative instrume nts, consisting of foreign cu rrency contracts to mitigate the foreign currency excha nge \nrisk of our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies ot her than the functional currency. We do not use derivatives for trading or \nspeculative purposes. These instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value and classified within Lev el 2 of \nthe fair value hierarchy. Gains and losses on the derivative in struments that are not designated as hedging instruments are rec ognized \nin other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements  of operations. The cash flows as sociated with our non-designated \nderivatives are classified in cash flows from investing activities on our consolidated statement of cash flows. \nWe have master netting arrangements with ce rtain counterparties to our foreign currenc y exchange contracts, which are designed \nto reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions  with the same counterparty. We have elected to present the d erivative \nassets and derivative liabilities on a gross basis. Derivative asse ts are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets  and \nderivative liabilities are recorded in accrued and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. \nRestricted Investments \nAs of December 31, 2024, restricted investments on the consolidated balance sheets are comprised of marketable debt securities \nthat may include U.S. government and agency securities, commercial paper, corporate bonds, and time deposits, which are held in \ntrust accounts at third-party financial institutions pursuant to certain contracts with insurance providers. Restricted investments are \nclassified as non-current assets as these investments are unavailable for use in short-term operations due to legal and/or contractual \nrestrictions. \nEquity Method Investments \nInvestments in common stock or in-substan ce common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant \ninfluence, but not a controlling financial interest, over the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, unless the \nfair value option is elected. Investments accounted for under th e equity method are initially reco rded at cost. Subsequently, w e \nrecognize through the consolidated statements of operations and as an adjustment to the investment balance, our proportionate share of \nthe investees’ net income or loss and the amortization of basis di fferences. We record our share of the results of equity metho d \ninvestments one quarter in arrears as income  (loss) from equity method investment, net of tax in the consolidated statements of  \noperations. We evaluate each of our equity method invest ments at the end of each reporting pe riod to determine whether events o r \nchanges in business circumstances indicate that the carrying valu e of the investment may not be fully recoverable. We recognize in the \nconsolidated statements of operations and as an adjustment to  the investment balance, any required impairment loss. Evidence of  a \nloss in value might include, but would not n ecessarily be limited to, absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of t he \ninvestment or inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investmen t. This \nevaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors including recent financial results and operating trends of the investee; \nimplied values in recent transactions of investee securities ; other publicly availabl e information that may affect the value of  our \ninvestments. \nEvaluation of Long-Lived Assets for Impairment \nWe evaluate our held-and-used long-lived as sets for indicators of  possible impairment when events  or changes in circumstances \nindicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group (collectiv ely, the “asset group”) may not be recoverable. We measure th e \nrecoverability of the asset group by comparing the carrying amount of such asset groups to the future undiscounted cash flows i t \nexpects the asset group to generate. If we consider the asset group  to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount \nby which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value. \nFair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments \nFair value is defined as the price that woul d be received to sell an asset or paid to  transfer a liability in an orderly transa ction \nbetween market participants at the measurement date. In accord ance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”), we use the \nfair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hi erarchy, as defined below, gives the highest priority \nto unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets  or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable input s. The three \nlevels of the fair value hierarchy are set forth below:  \nLevel 1 Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. ",
          " \n87 \nLevel 2 Observable inputs other th an Level 1 prices such as quoted  prices for similar assets or  liabilities in active markets, \nquoted prices in markets that are not ac tive or inputs other than the quoted prices  that are observable either directly \nor indirectly for the full term of the assets or liabilities. \nLevel 3 Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or \nliabilities. \nOur primary financial instruments include receivables, investme nts in debt and equity securi ties, accounts payable, accrued \nliabilities, long-term debt and warrants. The estimated fair valu e of marketable debt securiti es, accounts receivable, accounts  payable \nand accrued liabilities approximates their ca rrying value due to the short-term maturiti es of these instruments. Refer to Note 3 – \nInvestments and Fair Value Measurement and Note 8 – Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit Arrangements for further information. \nVariable Interest Entities \nWe evaluate our ownership, contra ctual, and other interests in entities to determin e if we have a variable interest in an entit y. \nThese evaluations are complex and involve judgment, estimates, and assumptions based on available historical and prospective \ninformation, among other factors. If we determine that an entity for which we hold a c ontractual or ownership interest in is a VIE and \nthat we are the primary beneficiary, we c onsolidate such entity in the consolidated financial st atements. The primary beneficia ry of a \nVIE is the party that meets both of the foll owing criteria: (1) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the \neconomic performance of the VIE; and (2) has the obligation to absorb  losses or the right to receive benefits that in either ca se could \npotentially be significant to the VIE. Periodi cally, we determine whether any changes in  the interest or relationship with the entity \nimpact the determination of whether the entity is still a VIE and whether we are still the primary beneficiary. If we are not d eemed to \nbe the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with appl icable \nGAAP. Refer to Note 15 – Variable Interest Entities for further information. \nRevenue Recognition \nWe recognize revenue when or as we satisfy our obligations. We derive revenue from Driver s’ and Merchants’ use of our \nplatform, on-demand lead generation, and related services, includi ng facilitating payments from end-users. The service enables \nDrivers and Merchants to seek, receive and fulfill on-demand requests from end-users seeking Mobility or Delivery services \n(collectively the “Uber Service”). In many of our markets, we also generate revenue from end-users. In these markets, we charge  end-\nusers a direct fee for use of the platform  or in exchange for Mobility or Delivery services. Additionally, we derive revenue fr om \ncustomers' use of Freight services. \n \nWe periodically reassess our revenue recognition policies as business models and other factors evolve. \nMobility and Delivery Agreements \nWe primarily enter into Master Services Agreements (“MSA”) with Drivers and Merchants to use the platform. The MSA defines \nthe service fee we charge Drivers and Merchants for each transac tion. Upon acceptance of a transa ction, Drivers and Merchants a gree \nto perform the services as requested by an end-user. The acceptance of a transaction request combined with the MSA establishes \nenforceable rights and obligations for each transaction. A contra ct exists between us and the Drivers and Merchants after the D rivers \nand Merchants accept a transaction request and the Drivers’ and Merchants’ ability to cancel the transaction lapses. \nThe Uber Service activities are performed to satisfy our sole pe rformance obligation in the tran saction, which is to connect \nDrivers and Merchants with end-users to facilitate the completion of a successful transaction. \nIn markets where we are responsible for M obility services to end-users,  end-users are our customer s and our sole performance \nobligation in the transaction is to provide  transportation services to the end-user. In markets where we are responsible for De livery \nservices to end-users, Merchants and end-users are our customer s. In addition to our performance obligation to Merchants, our \nperformance obligation to end-users is to provide delivery services. \nIn markets where we charge Mobility and Delivery end-users a fe e to use the platform, we have a performance obligation to end-\nusers to connect them to Drivers and Merchants in the marketplace. \nPrincipal vs. Agent Accounting Considerations \nJudgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or  agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users . \nWe evaluate the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-use r and \nare the principal (i.e. “gross”), or we arra nge for other parties to provide the servi ce to the end-user and are an agent (i.e.  “net”). This \ndetermination also impacts the presentation of incentives provide d to Drivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to \nend-users to the extent they are not customers.  \nIn Mobility and Delivery transactions where our role is to provi de the Uber Service to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a \nsuccessful trip or Delivery service, we do not control and are not primarily responsible for the good or service provided by Drivers and \nMerchants to end-users. In these transactions, Mobility and Delivery revenue is recorded on a net basis. ",
          " \n88 \nIn markets where we agree to provide Mobility or Delivery servic es to end-users for a fee, we are primarily responsible for the  \nservices and present the respective Mobility and Delivery revenue on a gross basis. Payments to Dr ivers and Couriers in exchang e for \ntheir services are recorded as cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization. \nMobility  \nWe derive our Mobility revenue from service fees paid by Drivers for use of the plat form and related service to connect with \nRiders and successfully complete a trip via the Platform, amounts charged to end-users for Mobility services, and fees charged to end-\nusers for use of the platform in certain markets. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete.  \nDepending on the market where the trip is comp leted, the service fee is either a fixed percentage of the end-user fare or the \ndifference between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount  earned by Drivers. In markets where we earn the difference \nbetween the amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned by Drivers, end-users are quoted a fixed upfront price for ridesha ring \nservices while we pay Drivers based on actual time and distance fo r the ridesharing services provided. We typically receive the service \nfee within a short period of time following the completion of a trip. \nIn certain markets, end-users have the option to pay cash for trips. Service fees for cash trips are recognized only when colle cted \nfrom Drivers as we concluded that collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. \nMobility revenue also includes immaterial revenue streams such as our financial partnerships products. \nDelivery \nWe derive our Delivery revenue from service fees paid by Couriers  and Merchants for use of the platform and related service to \nsuccessfully complete meal preparation, grocery and other delivery service on the platform, amounts charged to end-users for Delivery \nservices, and fees charged to end-users for use of the platform in certain markets. We recognize revenue when a Delivery transaction is \ncomplete. \nIn the majority of transactions, the service fee paid by Merchants is a fixed percentage of the meal price. The service fee pai d by \nCouriers is the difference between the delivery fee amount paid  by the end-user and the amount earned by the Couriers. End-user s are \nquoted a fixed price for the meal delivery while we pay Couriers  based on time and distance for the delivery. We typically rece ive the \nservice fee within a short period of time following the completion of a delivery. \nFreight \nWe derive our Freight revenue from freight brokerage, transportation management and related services provided to Shippers. \nBrokerage \nBrokerage revenue represents the gross amount of fees charged to  Shippers for brokerage services provided to Shippers. Costs \nincurred with independent freight carriers fo r Brokerage are recorded in cost of reve nue. Shippers contract with us to utilize our \nnetwork of independent freight carriers to tr ansport freight. We enter into contracts wi th Shippers that define the price for e ach \nshipment and payment terms and our acceptance of the shipment request from Shippers establishes enforceable rights and obligati ons \nfor each contract. We enter into separate contracts with independent freight carriers and are responsible for payment of freigh t charges \nto the carrier regardless of payment by the Shipper. We invoi ce the Shipper upon satisfaction of our sole performance obligatio n to \nfacilitate the transportation of the Shi pper’s freight through our network of indepe ndent freight carriers. We recognize revenu e \nassociated with our performance obligation over the contract te rm, which represents our performance over the period of time a \nshipment is in transit. While the transit period of our contr acts can vary based on origin and destination, contracts still in transit at \nperiod end are not material. Payment for our services is generally due within 30 to 45 days upon receipt of invoice. \nTransportation Management \nOur Transportation Management services can include shipment  planning, freight optimization, carrier assignment, load \nmanagement, freight audit and payment proc essing and other Transportation Management related services. Our sole performance \nobligation in these contracts is the integr ation of these services that allow for th e transport of the Shipper’s freight by ind ependent \nfreight carriers. Transportation Ma nagement revenue is recognized on a gross basis in the amount of gross fees charged to Shipp ers \nupon satisfaction of our performance obligation. Costs incurred w ith independent freight carriers for these transactions are re corded in \ncost of revenue. Revenue is recognized as our performance obliga tion is satisfied, which generally represents the transit perio d from \norigin to destination by an independent freight carrier. While th e transit period of our contract s can vary based on origin and  \ndestination, contracts still in transit at period end are not ma terial. Payment for our services is generally due within 30 to 60 days upon \ncompletion of our performance obligation. \nPrincipal vs. Agent Accounting Considerations \nJudgment is required in determining whether we recognize the fees  charged to Shippers on a gross or net basis. We record the \nmajority of our revenue from Brokerage a nd Transportation Management on a gross basis at the amounts charged to Shippers as we \nare primarily responsible for facilitating the transportation of Shippers’ goods with independent freight carriers that meet the Shipper’s \nspecifications. We also have pricing discretion for the price(s) charged to Shippers and amounts paid to Carriers. ",
          " \n89 \nAdvertising Revenue \nWe derive the majority of our advertisi ng revenue from sponsored listing fees paid by Merchants and brands in exchange for \nadvertising on our platform. Adve rtising revenue is recognized when an end-user  engages with the sponsored listing based on the  \nnumber of clicks. Revenue is presented on a gross basis in  the amount billed to Merchants and brands as we control the advertisement \nbefore it is transferred to the end-user.  \nIncentives to Customers  \nIncentives provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service or cann ot \nreasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service received . Incentives to customers that are not provided in exchange f or a \ndistinct good or service are evaluated as variable consideration, in the most likely amount to be earned by the customer at the  time or \nas they are earned by customers, depending on the type of incen tive. Since incentives are earned over a short period of time, t here is \nlimited uncertainty when estimating variable consideration. \nIncentives earned by customers for referring new customers are paid  in exchange for a distinct service and are accounted for as  \ncustomer acquisition costs. We expense such referral payments as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated \nstatements of operations. We expense costs to acquire new customer contracts as incurred because the amortization period would be \none year or less. The amount recorded as an expense is the lesse r of the amount of the incentive pa id or the established fair v alue of \nthe service received. Fair value of the service is established using amounts paid to vendors for similar services. The amounts paid to \ncustomers presented as sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024 were immaterial. \nIn some transactions, incentives and payments made to customers may exceed the revenue earned in the transaction. In these \ntransactions, the resulting shortfall amount is recorded as a reduction of revenue. \nEnd-User Discounts and Promotions \nWe offer discounts and promotions to end-users to encourage use of our platform. Th ese are offered in various forms of discount s \nand promotions and include: \nTargeted end-user discounts and promotions:  These discounts and promotions are offered to a limited number of end-users in a \nmarket to acquire, re-engage, or generally increase end-users use of the Platform, and are akin to a coupon. An example is an o ffer \nproviding a discount on a limited number of rides or deliveries during a limited time period. We record the cost of these discounts and \npromotions to end-users who are not our customers as sales and marketing expenses at the time they are redeemed by the end-user. \nEnd-user referrals:  These referrals are earned when an existing end-user (the referring end-user) refers a new end-user (the \nreferred end-user) to the platform and the new end-user who is  not our customer completes thei r first transaction on the platfo rm. \nThese referrals are typically paid in the form of a credit given to the referring end-user. These referrals are offered to attr act new end-\nusers to the Platform. We record the liability for these referrals and corresponding expenses as sales and marketing expenses a t the \ntime the referral is earned by the referring end-user. \nMarket-wide promotions: These promotions are pricing actions in the form of  discounts that reduce the end-user fare charged by \nDrivers and Merchants to end-users who are not our customers for all or substantially all Mobility or Delivery offerings in a s pecific \nmarket. This also includes any discounts offered under our subscr iption offerings and certain discounts within the Uber Rewards  \nprograms, which enable end-users to receive a fixed fare or a disc ount on all eligible rides. Accordingly, we record the cost o f these \npromotions as a reduction of revenue at the time the transaction is completed. \nRefunds and Credits \nRefunds and credits to end-users due to end-user dissatisfaction with the Platform are recorded as sales and marketing expenses or \nas a reduction of revenue depending on whether the end-user is c onsidered a customer based on the market. Refunds to end-users that \nwe recover from Drivers and Merchants are recorded as a reduction of revenue. \nOther \nWe have elected to exclude from revenue, taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and are concurrent \nwith specific revenue producing transactions, and collected from Drivers, Merchants and end-users and remitted to governmental \nauthorities. Accordingly, such amounts are not included as a component of revenue or cost of revenue. \nPractical Expedients \nWe have utilized the pr actical expedient available under ASC 606-10-50-14 and do  not disclose the va lue of unsatisfied \nperformance obligations for contracts with an original expected  length of one year or less. We have no significant financing \ncomponents in our contracts with customers. ",
          " \n90 \nStock-Based Compensation \nWe account for stock-based comp ensation expense in acco rdance with the fair va lue recognition and meas urement provisions of \nGAAP, which requires compensation cost for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite \nservice period. We account for forfeitures when they occur. The fa ir value of stock-based awards, granted or modified, is deter mined \non the grant date (or modification or acquisition dates, if appli cable) at fair value, using a ppropriate valuation techniques. The fair \nvalue of common stock was determined on the grant date using the closing price of our common stock. \nService-Based Awards \nWe record stock-based compensation expense for service-based stoc k options and restricted stock units (“RSU(s)”) on a straight-\nline basis over the requisite service period, which is generally four years. \nFor stock options with service-based vesting conditions only, th e valuation model, typically th e Black-Scholes option-pricing \nmodel, incorporates various assumptions in cluding expected stock price volatility, expect ed term and risk-free interest rates. We \nestimate the volatility of common stock on the date of grant ba sed on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility of our own \nshares or comparable publicly traded companies in our industry group. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury  yield \ncurve in effect at the time of grant with a term equal to the expected term. We estimate the expected term based on the simplif ied \nmethod for employee stock options considered to be “plain vanilla” options, as our historical share option exercise experience does not \nprovide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. We estimate the expected term for non-employees’ options based \non the contractual term. The expected dividend yield is 0.0% as  we have not paid and do not anticipate paying dividends on our \ncommon stock. \nPerformance-Based Awards \nWe have granted restricted common stock awards (“RSA(s)”), RSUs, stock appreciation rights (“SAR(s)”), and stock options that \nvest upon the satisfaction of both service-based and perform ance-based conditions. The servic e-based condition for these awards  \ngenerally is satisfied over three or four  years. The performance-based conditions generally are satisfied upon achieving specif ied \nperformance targets, such as our financial or operating metrics.  We record stock-based compensation expense for performance-bas ed \nequity awards such as RSAs, RSUs, SARs, and stock options on an  accelerated attribution method over the requisite service perio d, \nwhich is generally three or four years, and only if performance-based conditions are considered probable to be satisfied. \nFor performance-based awards and RSUs, we determine the grant-date  fair value to be the fair value of our common stock on the \ngrant date. \nFor performance-based SARs, stock options, and warrants, we determ ine the grant-date fair value utilizing the valuation model a s \ndescribed above for service-based awards. \nMarket-Based Awards \nWe have granted RSUs and stock options that vest only u pon the satisfaction of the following conditions: service-based \nconditions, performance-based conditions, and/or market-based c onditions. The service-based condition for these awards generall y is \nsatisfied over three or four years. The performance-based conditions generally are satisfied upon achieving specified performan ce \ntargets. The market-based conditions are satisfied upon our achieve ment of specified fully-diluted equity values, as determined  based \non our stock price. \nFor market-based awards, we de termine the grant-date fair value utilizing a M onte Carlo valuation model, which incorporates \nvarious assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected term, and risk-free interest rates. We estimate the vol atility of \ncommon stock on the date of grant based on historical volatility of  Uber’s stock price. We estimate the expected term based on various \nexercise scenarios. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. \nWe record stock-based compensation expense for market-based equi ty awards such as RSUs and stock options on an accelerated \nattribution method over the requisi te service period, and only if  performance-based conditions are considered probable to be sa tisfied. \nWe determine the requisite service period by comparing the deri ved service period to achieve the market-based condition and the  \nexplicit service-based period, using the longer of the two service periods as the requisite service period. \nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) \nWe recognize stock-based expenses related to shares issued pursuant to our ESPP on a straight-line basis over the offering peri od. \nThe ESPP provides for twelve-month offering periods, and each offering period includes two purchase periods of approximately si x \nmonths. The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at a 15 percent discount on the lower price o f \neither (i) the offering period begin date or (ii) the purchase date. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under th e ESPP \nbased on a combination of options valued  using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.  We determine volatility over an expected \nterm of six months and twelve months based on our historical volatility. We estimate the expected term based on the contractual term. ",
          " \n91 \nIncome Taxes \nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability met hod, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and \nliabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements. \nWe account for uncertainty in tax positions  recognized in the consolid ated financial statements by recognizing a tax benefit fr om \nan uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be  sustained upon examination, including resol utions of \nany related appeals or litigation processes, based on the techni cal merits. Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-n ot \nrecognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized. \nWe recognize accrued interest a nd penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for (benefit from) income tax es \nin the consolidated statements of operations. \nValuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce de ferred tax assets to the amounts that are more-likely-than-not \nexpected to be realized based on the wei ghting of positive and negative evidence. Future  realization of deferred tax assets ult imately \ndepends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appr opriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gai n) \nwithin the carryback or carryforward periods available under the a pplicable tax law. We regularly review the deferred tax asset s for \nrecoverability based on historical taxable in come, projected future taxable income, ex cess tax benefits related to stock-based \ncompensation, the expected timing of the reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies. Our judgment \nregarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future mark et conditions and the ability to successful ly \nexecute our business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ab ility to recover deferred tax asse ts, our \nincome tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in  which the assessment is changed. We elected the tax law orderi ng \napproach in assessing the realizability of  net operating losses expected to offset future Global Intangible Low-taxed Income \n(“GILTI”). \nWe have elected to treat any potential GILTI inclusions as a period cost. \nThe establishment of deferred tax assets fr om intra-entity transfers of intangible as sets requires management to make significa nt \nestimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of such intangible assets. Si gnificant estimates in valuing intangible as sets may \ninclude, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue and expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible asset s, \ncomparable transaction values, and/or disc ount rates. The discount rates used to disc ount expected future cash flows to present  value \nare derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash  flow. \nAlthough we believe the assumptions and estimates utilized are re asonable and appropriate, they ar e based, in part, on historic al \nexperience, internal and external comparable data and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occu r \nthat could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. \nCosts and Expenses \nSet forth below is a brief description of the components of our expenses: \n• Cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily consists of costs in curred for certain Mobility and \nDelivery transactions where we are primar ily responsible for Mobility and Delivery services and pay Drivers and Couriers \nfor services, certain insurance costs rela ted to our Mobility and Delivery offerings , costs incurred with  Carriers for Uber \nFreight transportation services, credit card processing fees, ba nk fees, data center and networking expenses, mobile device \nand service costs, and amounts related to fare chargebacks and other credit card losses. \n• Operations and support expenses  primarily consist of compensation costs,  including stock-based compensation, for \nemployees that support operations in cities, including the ge neral managers, Driver operations, platform user support \nrepresentatives and community managers. Also included is th e cost of customer support, Driver background checks and the \nallocation of certain corporate costs. \n• Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of advertisi ng costs, product marketing costs,  discounts, loyalty programs, \npromotions, refunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers, compensation costs, including stock-based \ncompensation to sales and marketing employees, and the allocati on of certain corporate costs. We expense advertising and \nother promotional expenditures as incurred . Advertising expenses totaled $1.7 billion for each of the years ended December \n31, 2022 and 2023 and $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024. Discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, \nand credits provided to end-users who are not customers totaled $2.2 billion, $1.7 billion, and $1.4 billion for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively. \n• Research and development expenses  primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for \nemployees in engineering, design and product developmen t. Expenses also include ongoing improvements to, and \nmaintenance of, existing products and services, and allocation of certain corporate costs. \n• General and administrative expenses  primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for \nexecutive management and administra tive employees, including finance and accounting, human resources, policy and \ncommunications, legal, and certain impairment charges, as we ll as allocation of certain corporate costs, occupancy, and ",
          " \n92 \ngeneral corporate insurance costs. General and administrative expenses also include certain legal related accruals and \nexpenses. \n• Depreciation and amortization expenses  primarily consist of depreciation on build ings, site improvements, computer and \nnetwork equipment, software, leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and amortization of intangible assets. \nRestructuring and Related Charges \nCosts associated  with management-appr oved restructuring activities,  including reductions in head count, exiting a market or \nconsolidation of facilities are recognized wh en they are incurred and may include employee termination benefits, impairment of long-\nlived assets (including impairment of opera ting lease right-of-use assets), contract termination costs and accelerated lease co st for \nright-of-use assets that ceased to be used. We record a liabili ty for employee termination benefits either when it is probable that an \nemployee is entitled to them and the amount of the benefits can be reasonably estimated or when management has communicated the  \ntermination plan to employees and all of the following conditions  have been met: management, having the authority to approve th e \naction, commits to a plan of termination; the plan identifies the number of employees to be terminated, their job classificatio ns and \ntheir locations, and the expected completion date; the plan establishes the terms of th e benefit arrangement in sufficient deta il to \nenable employees to determine the type and amount of benefits they will receive if they are involuntarily terminated; and actio ns \nrequired to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to th e plan will be made or that the plan w ill be \nwithdrawn. We accrue for costs to terminate contracts other than a lease when we terminate the contract in accordance with the \ncontract terms. Costs that will continue to be incurred for the remaining term of a contract that is not a lease, and provide no economic \nbenefits to us are recognized at the cease-use date. Costs asso ciated with lease contracts are accounted for under the leasing \naccounting guidance or under the long-lived assets accounting guidance. \nRestructuring and related charges are recognized as an operating e xpense within the consolidated statements of operations and a re \nclassified based on our classification policy for each category of operating expense. Personnel costs are classified based on e ach \nemployee’s classification, lease costs (including impairments of right-of-use assets) are classified in the same expense line i tem where \neach lease’s rent expense was rec ognized and impairment  of other long-lived asse ts are recorded within general and administrati ve \nexpenses. \nForeign Currency \nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency or U.S. dollar depending on the nature of the subsidiaries’ \nactivities. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured to the functional \ncurrency at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period. Gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are recorded in  foreign \nexchange gains (losses), net within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Subsidiary assets  and \nliabilities with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are translated  at the month-end rate, retained earnings and other equity  items are \ntranslated at historical rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year. Cumulative \ntranslation adjustments are recorded within accumulated other co mprehensive income (loss), a separate component of total equity  \n(deficit). \nNet Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders \nWe compute net income (loss) per share using the two-class me thod required for participating securities. The two-class method \nrequires income available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securiti es \nbased upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed.  \nOur restricted common stock, and common stock issued upon early  exercise of stock options are participating securities. We \nconsider restricted common stock and any shares issued upon early exercise of stock options, subject to repurchase, to be participating \nsecurities because holders of such shares have non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event a ca sh dividend is declared on comm on \nstock. \nInsurance Reserves \nWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance \nsubsidiary, to provide for the potential li abilities for certain risks, including au to liability, uninsured and underinsured mo torist, auto \nphysical damage, general liability, and workers’ compensation. Insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment \nexpenses, which represents the estimate of the ultimate unpaid ob ligation for such insurance rela ted risks and includes an amou nt for \ncase reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of \nthe ultimate unpaid obligati on utilizes generally accepted actuari al methods applied to historic al claim and loss experience. I n \naddition, we use assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs , \nwhich consider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant i ndustry data. These reserves are continually reviewed and adjus ted as \nexperience develops and new information becomes known. Adjustment s to reserves for risks retained by us, if any, relating to \naccidents that occurred in prior years ar e reflected in the current year results of operations. Reserve amounts estimated to be  settled \nwithin one year are recorded in short-term  insurance reserves, with longer term settle ments recorded in long-term insurance res erves \non the consolidated balance sheets. Insurance recoverables are rec ognized when we enter into contracts that transfer the risk r ecorded ",
          " \n93 \nin our insurance reserves to third-party insurance companies. R ecoverable amounts estimated to be recovered within one year are  \nrecorded in prepaid expenses and other curr ent assets, with longer term recoverables recorded in other assets on the consolidat ed \nbalance sheets.  \nWhile management believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less th an, \nthe amount provided. All estimates of ultim ate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resu lting reserves, are su bject to \ninherent variability caused by the nature of the insurance claim se ttlement process. Such variabil ity is increased for us due t o limited \nhistorical experience and the nature of the coverage provided. Actual results depend upon the outcome of future contingent even ts and \ncan be affected by many factors, such as cl aims settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal, and social environment s. As \na result, the net amount s that will ultimately be paid to settle the liabil ity and when these amounts w ill be paid may vary fro m the \nestimate provided on the consolidated balance sheets. \nLoss Contingencies \nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, indirect tax examinations or government inquiries and investigations \nthat may arise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indet erminate \namounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be \nreasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of  loss can be reasonably estima ted, we \ndisclose the possible loss in the consolidated financial statements. \nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could af fect the amount of the provisions  that have been previously \nrecorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses di sclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes t o our \ndisclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated infor mation. \nSignificant judgment is required to determine both the probability and the estimated amount of loss. \nThe outcomes of litigation, indirect tax exam inations and investig ations are inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of  \nthese matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations, financial  \ncondition, or cash flows, including in a particular reporting period in which any su ch outcome becomes probable and estimable, could \nbe materially adversely affected. \nWe recognize estimated loss es from contingencies that relate  to proceedings in wh ich Drivers are the plaintiffs, or proceedings  \nand regulatory penalties against Drivers for which we elect to eith er pay on behalf of or reimbur se Drivers, as a reduction of revenue \nin the consolidated statements of operations. All other esti mated losses from contingencies are recognized in general and \nadministrative expenses. \nLegal fees and other costs associated with such actions are expensed as incurred. \nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements \nIn June 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB ”) issued ASU 2022-03, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): \nFair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions,” which clarifies that contractual sale restrictions \nare not considered in measuring fair value of equity securities  and requires additional disclosures for equity securities subje\nct to \ncontractual sale restrictions. The standard is effective for pub lic companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 202 3. We \nadopted the ASU on January 1, 2024. The add itional required disclosures did not have a material impa ct on our consolidated financial \nstatements. \nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment  Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment \nDisclosures,” which adds required disclosures of significant expenses for each reportable segment, as well as certain other dis closures \nto help investors understand how the chief operating decision make r (“CODM”) evaluates segment expenses and operating results. \nThe new standard also allows disclosure of multiple measures of segment profitability, if those measures are used to allocate resources \nand assess performance. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and \ninterim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We adopted the new standard on January 1, 2024 on a \nretrospective basis. Refer to Note 13 – Segment Information and Geographic Information for further information. \nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted \nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxe s (Topic 740): Improvements to  Income Tax Disclosures,” \nwhich requires disaggregated information a bout a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on  income \ntaxes paid. The standard is intended to benefit investors by provi ding more detailed income tax disclosures that would be usefu l in \nmaking capital allocation decisions. The standard will be effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after Decem ber 15, \n2024. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidate d \nfinancial statements and related disclosures. \nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, \"Inc ome Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense \nDisaggregation Disclosures,\" which requires disclosure of add itional information about specific expense categories underlying certain \nincome statement expense line items.

Level 1 inst rument valuations are based on quoted market  \nprices of the identical underlying security. Level 2 instrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for \ncomparable instruments, identical instrument s in less active markets, or models usi ng market observable inputs. Level 3 instrum ent \nvaluations are valued based on unobservable inputs and other estim ation techniques due to the absence of quoted market prices, \ninherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such financial instruments. ",
          " \n97 \nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2024, our Le vel 3 non-marketable equity securities and note receiv able from a related party \nprimarily consist of common stock investments and convertible secu red notes that may be converted into common or preferred stoc k \nin privately held companies without readily determinable fair values. \nDepending on the investee’s financ ing activity in a reporting period, management’s  estimate of fair value may be primarily \nderived from the investee’s financing transactions, such as the i ssuance of preferred stock to ne w investors. The price in thes e \ntransactions generally provides the best indication of the enterprise value of th e investee. Additionally, based on the timing,  volume, \nand other characteristics of the transaction, we may supplement this information by using other valuation techniques, including  the \nguideline public company approach. The guideline public company appr oach relies on publicly availabl e market data of comparable  \ncompanies and uses compar ative valuation multiple s of the investee’s revenue  (actual and forecasted),  and therefore, unobservab le \ninput used in this valuation technique primarily consists of short-term revenue projections. \nOnce the fair value of the investee is estimated, an option-pr icing model (“OPM”), a common stock equivalent (“CSE”) method \nor a hybrid approach is employed to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us. The \nmodel involves making assumptions around the investees’ expected time to liquidity and volatility. \nAn increase or decrease in any of the unobservable inputs in is olation, such as the security price in a signifi cant financing \ntransaction of the investee, could result in a material increase  or decrease in our estimate of fair value. Other unobservable inputs, \nincluding short-term revenue projections, time  to liquidity, and volatility are less se nsitive to the valuation in the respecti ve reporting \nperiods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee’s  financing transactions. In th e future, depending on the weight of \nevidence and valuation approaches used, these or other inputs may have a more significant impact on our estimate of fair value. \nWe determine realized gains or losses on the sale of equity and debt securities on a specific identification method. \nZomato Investment \nDuring the third quarter of 2022, we complete d the sale of $418 million of our entire stake in Zomato  ordinary shares for net \nproceeds of $376 million and recognized an immate rial loss from this transa ction in other income (exp ense), net in our consolid ated \nstatement of operations. \nAurora Investment \nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2024, our Class A common stock in Aurora (“Aurora Investment”) have been classified as a \nmarketable equity security with a readily determinable fair value (Level 1) in the table presenting our financial assets measur ed at fair \nvalue on a recurring basis.

Such fair value measurements are based predominately on Level 3 inputs. \nNon-Marketable Equity Securities \nOur non-marketable equity securities are investments in privatel y held companies without readily determinable fair values. The \ncarrying value of our non-marketable equity securities are adjusted based on price changes from observable transactions of identical or \nsimilar securities of the same issuer (referred to as the measur ement alternative) or for impair ment. Any changes in carrying value are \nrecorded within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Non-marketable equity securities are \nclassified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we  estimate the fair value of these securities based on valuation  methods, \nincluding the CSE and OPM methods, using the transaction price of simila r securities issued by the investee adjusted for contra ctual \nrights and obligations of the securities we hold.  \nThe following is a summary of unrealized gains and losses from remeasurement (referred to as upward or downward adjustments) \nrecorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations, and included as adjustments to the carrying value \nof non-marketable equity securities held during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024 based on the observable price in \nan orderly transaction for the same or similar security of the same issuers (in millions):  \n  Year Ended December 31, \n  2022  2023  2024 \nUpward adjustments  $ 1,046   $ 908   $ 657  \nDownward adjustments (including impairment)   (641)    (472)    (328)  \nTotal unrealized gain (loss) for non-marketable equity securities  $ 405   $ 436   $ 329  \nThe following table summarizes the total carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities measured at fair value on a non-\nrecurring basis held, including cumulative unrealized upward and downward adjustments made to the initial cost basis of the securities \n(in millions): \n  As of December 31, \n  2023  2024 \nInitial cost basis  $ 1,727   $ 2,030  \nUpward adjustments   1,960    2,611  \nDownward adjustments (including impairment)   (1,113)    (1,442)  \nTotal carrying value at the end of the period  $ 2,574   $ 3,199  \nWe did not record any realized gains or lo sses for our non-marketable equity securities measured at fair value on a non-recurri ng \nbasis during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024. \nDidi Investment \nIn the second quarter of 2022, Didi co mpleted their delisting from the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE Delisting”). We \nconcluded the ordinary sh ares held by us did not have a readily determinable fair va lue and should be accounted for under the \nmeasurement alternative method. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, Didi American Depositary Shares (“ADS”) continue to be \ntraded in the over-the-counter (“OTC”) market. We determined that the Didi ADS were similar to the ordinary shares held prior t o the \nNYSE Delisting. We then measured the investment to fair value ba sed on the closing share price of the Didi ADS on the OTC marke t \non December 31, 2023 and 2024  as an observable transaction fo r similar securities. As of Decem ber 31, 2023 and 2024, our Didi \ninvestment is classified as a non-marketable equity security a nd is measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis with a read ily \navailable price based on signifi cant other observable inputs (Level 2). We rec ognized a net unrealized loss of $1.0 billion, a net ",
          " \n99 \nunrealized gain of $443 million and a net un realized gain of $357 million on this investment in othe r income (expense), net in our \nconsolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively. \nNote 4 - Equity Method Investments  \nThe carrying value of our equity method investments were as follows (in millions): \n  As of December 31, \n  2023  2024 \nCareem Technologies  $ 300   $ 241  \nOther   53    61  \nEquity method investments  $ 353   $ 302  \nCareem Technologies Investment \nIn April 2023, we entered into a series of agreements with Emirates Telecommunication Group Company (“e&”) whereby e& will \ncontribute $400 million into the Careem non-ridesharing business (“Careem Technologies”) in exchange for a majority equity interest. \nUpon closing of the transaction in December 2023, e& acquired a majority stake in  Careem Technologies and we retained a minorit y \nownership interest. Careem Technologies is considered a related party to us upon the closing of th e transaction. We continue to  fully \nown the ridesharing business of Careem. \nUpon closing of the transaction,  we recognized a gain of approximately $204 m illion during the fourth qu arter of 2023, in other  \nincome (expense), net on our consolidated statement of operati ons. Additionally, we received two seats on Careem Technologies’ \nboard and retained an approximately 42% equity ownership intere st consisting of common stock in Careem Technologies. The initia l \nfair value of our equity method investment in Careem Technologies was $300 million. The investment was determined to be an equity \nmethod investment due to our ability to exercise significant influence over Careem Technologies. \nIncluded in the initial carrying value of $3 00 million was a basis difference related to the difference between  the cost of the  \ninvestment and our proportionate share of th e net assets of Careem Technologies. As of December 31, 2024, this basis difference  was \nnot material. The carrying value of the equ ity method investment is adjusted for our share in the income or losses of Careem \nTechnologies on a one-quarter lag basis and amortization of basis differences. \nWe amortize the basis difference related to the intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the assets that gave rise to the \ndifference using the straight-line method. Equity method goodwill is not amortized. \nMLU B.V . Investment \nDuring 2018, we closed a transaction that contributed the net as sets of our Uber Russia/CIS operations into a newly formed \nprivate limited liability company (“MLU B.V .” or “Yandex.Taxi  joint venture”), with Yandex N.V (“Yandex”) and us holding \nownership interests in MLU B.V . In excha nge for consideration contribut ed, we received a seat on MLU B.V .’s board and an initia l \n38% equity ownership interest consisting of common stock in MLU B.V . The investment was determ ined to be an  equity method \ninvestment due to our ability to exercise significant influence over MLU B.V . \nWe review for impairment whenever factors indicate that th e carrying value of the equity method investment may not be \nrecoverable. During the first quarter of 2022, we determined that our investment in MLU B.V . was other-than-temporarily impaire d, \nand recorded an impairment charge of $182 million in other inco me (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations. T he \nimpairment was primarily due to consensus projections of a protracted recession of the Russian economy as a result of Russia's \ninvasion of Ukraine. To determine the fair value of our investment in MLU B.V ., we u tilized a market approach referencing reven ue \nmultiples from publicly traded peer companies. \n2023 \nSale of Our Remaining Interest in MLU B.V . \nOn April 21, 2023, we entered into and closed on a definitive agreement to sell our remaining 29% equity interest in MLU B.V . to \nYandex for $703 million in cash a nd recognized an immaterial loss from this transaction recorded in other income (expense), net  in \nour consolidated statement of operations during the year ended D ecember 31, 2023. After this transaction, we no longer had an e quity \ninterest in MLU B.V . \nMLU B.V . Call Option \nIn 2021, we granted Yandex an option (“MLU B.V . Call Option”) to acquire our remaining equity interest in MLU B.V . The MLU \nB.V . Call Option was recorded as a liability in accrued and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, initi ally valued \nat $230 million and measured at fair value on a recurring basis with change s in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net in \nthe consolidated statements of operations.\n \nAs of December 31, 2022, the fair value of the MLU B.V . Call Option was $2 m illion. We recorded a $191 million net gain for ",
          " \n100 \nthe fair value change during the year ended December 31, 2022. To  determine the fair value of the MLU B.V . Call Option as of \nDecember 31, 2022, we used a lattice model which simulated multiple scenarios of the exercise behaviors and the corresponding strike \nprices over the term of the call option. Key inputs to the lattice model were: the unde rlying business value; option term of 0. 7 years; \nvolatility of 65%; risk-free interest rates; and strike price (Level 3). \nAs part of our sale of our remaining in terest in MLU B.V . to Yandex during the second quarter of 2023, the MLU B.V . Call \nOption was extinguished and we recognized a gain that was not mate rial in other income (expense), net in our consolidated state ment \nof operations during the year ended December 31, 2023. \nNote 5 – Property and Equipment, Net \nThe components of property and equipment, net were as follows (in millions): \n  As of December 31, \n  2023  2024 \nLand  $ 65   $ 65  \nBuilding and site improvements   739    739  \nLeasehold improvements   658    670  \nComputer equipment   542    436  \nLeased computer equipment   683    641  \nMotor vehicles and other equipment   2    51  \nInternal-use software   488    650  \nFurniture and fixtures   94    80  \nConstruction in progress   203    218  \nTotal   3,474    3,550  \nLess: Accumulated depreciation and amortization   (1,401)    (1,598)  \nProperty and equipment, net  $ 2,073   $ 1,952  \nAmounts in construction in progress represen t buildings, leasehold improvements, assets  under construction, and other assets no t \nplaced in service. \nDepreciation expense relating to  property and equipment was $346  million, $355 million, and $ 332 million for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively. \nNote 6 - Leases  \nOur leases primarily include corporate offices, data centers, a nd servers.

As a result, we recognized an immaterial loss on debt extinguishment for the year ended December 31, \n2024 in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations. Following the redemption, the 2026 Senior Note is no \nlonger outstanding. \nInterest on the 2030 Senior Note is payable semi-annually in arre ars on January 15 and July 15 of each year at 4.30% per annum,  \nbeginning January 15, 2025.

On March 3, 2023, we entered into a refinancing transaction under which we borrowed $1.75 billion (“First Closing”), the \nproceeds of which were used to repay in full the outstanding 2025 Refinanced Term Lo an of $1.4 billion and $317 million of the \noutstanding 2027 Refinanced Term Loan. On March 14, 2023, we en tered into the second refinancing transaction under which we \nborrowed $761 million (“Second Closing”), the proceeds of which were used to repay in full the outstanding 2027 Refinanced Term  \nLoan. The Second Closing c onstituted an additional term loan in  the same tranche as the First Closing (collectively, the “2030 \nRefinanced Term Loans”). \nThe 2030 Refinanced Term Loans had a maturity date of March 3,  2030. The interest rate for the 2030 Refinanced Term Loans \nwas Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) subject to a floor  of 0.00%, plus 2.75% per annum. The refinancing transactions \nqualified as both a debt modification and debt extinguishment. As a result, we rec ognized an immaterial loss on debt extinguish ment \nduring the year ended December 31, 2023 in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations. The refinan cing \ntransactions resulted in: (i) $1.1 billion cash inflow from the issuance of the 2030 Refi nanced Term Loans, net of issuance costs, from \nnew lenders and additional principal from ex isting lenders; (ii) a $1.1 billion cash out flow of principal payments on the 2025 \nRefinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan to exiti ng lenders and lower principal from existing lenders. The cash inflo w \nand cash outflow were recorded within cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated st atement of cash flows for the year \nended December 31, 2023. \nIn September 2024, we used a portion of the net proceeds from our Notes offering, discussed above, to repay, in full, all loans  \noutstanding under our term loan agreement, of which approximate ly $1.97 billion aggregate princi pal amount was outstanding as o f \nJune 30, 2024. As a result, we recognized an  immaterial loss on debt extinguishment for the year ended December 31, 2024 in oth er \nincome (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations. \n2028 Convertible Notes and Capped Call Transactions \n2028 Convertible Notes \nIn November 2023, we issued $1.73 billion aggregate principal amount of  0.875% convertible senior  notes due in 2028 (the \n“2028 Convertible Notes”), incl uding the exercise in full by th e initial purchasers of the 2028 Co nvertible Notes of their opti on to \npurchase up to an additional $225 million principal amount of the 2028 Convertible Notes.

The net proceeds from this offering we re approximately $1.70 billion, after \ndeducting the debt issuance costs. We used a portion of the net pr oceeds from this offering to fund the cost of entering into t he capped \ncall transactions, described below. Additionally, we used a portion of the net proceeds from this offering, along with cash on hand, to \npartially pay down $500 million of our 2030  Refinanced Term Loans in November 20 23 and redeem all of our outstanding 2025 \nSenior Note in December 2023.

Following the redemption, the 2025 Senior Note \nwas no longer outstanding. \nHolders of the 2028 Convertible Notes may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the  \nbusiness day immediately precedi ng September 1, 2028 only under th e following circumstances: (i ) during any calendar quarter \ncommencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2024 (a nd only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sa le \nprice of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of 30 consecutive trading  days ",
          " \n105 \nending on, and including, the last trading da y of the immediately preceding calendar quar ter is greater than or equal to 130% o f the \nconversion price on each applicable  trading day; (ii) during the five business day period after a ny ten consecutive trading day  period \n(the “2028 Convertible Notes measurement period”) in which the trading price (as defined in the indenture governing the 2028 \nConvertible Notes) per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each  trading day of the 2028 Convertible Notes measurement period w as \nless than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; (iii) \nif we call such notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the \napplicable redemption date; or (iv) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after September 1, 2028 until the close of \nbusiness on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of  their \nnotes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. \nAs of December 31, 2024, none of the conditions permitting the holders of the 2028 Convertible Notes to convert their notes early \nhad been met. Therefore, the 2028 Convertible Notes are classified as long-term. \nThe initial conversion rate is 13.7848 shares of the common stoc k per $1,000 principal amount of notes, equivalent to an initia l \nconversion price of approximately $72.54 per sh are of the common stock. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in so me \nevents but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. \nUpon conversion of the 2028 Convertible Notes, we must pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be \nconverted and pay or deliver as the case may be, cash, shares of  our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our \ncommon stock, at our election in respect of the remainder, if any, of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate prin cipal \namount of the notes being converted. \nWe may not redeem the notes prior to December 5, 2026.

The Ca pped Calls cover, subject to anti-diluti on adjustments, the num ber of \nshares of our common stock initially underlyi ng the 2028 Convertible Notes.  By entering into the Cappe d Calls, we expect to red uce \nthe potential dilution to our common stock (or, in the event a conversion of the 2028 Convertible Notes is settled in cash, to reduce our \ncash payment obligation) in the event that at the time of conve rsion of the 2028 Convertible Note s the trading price of our com mon \nstock price exceeds the conversion price of the 2028 Convertible Notes. \nThe initial cap price of the Capped Calls was approximately $95.81 per share, which represents a premium of 75% over the last \nreported sale price of our common stock of $54.75 on the New York Stock Exchange on November 20, 2023, and is subject to certai n \nadjustments under the terms of the Capped Ca lls.

As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, there was no preferred stock issued and outstanding. \nEquity Compensation Plans \nWe maintain four equity compensation plans that provide for th e issuance of shares of our common stock to our officers and \nother employees, directors, and consultant s: the 2010 Stock Plan (the “2010 Plan”), the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2013 \nPlan”), the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”), and the 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”), which have \nall been approved by stockholders. Following our IPO in May 2019, we have only issued awards under the 2019 Plan and the \nESPP, and no additional awards will be granted under the 2010 a nd 2013 Plans. These plans provide  for the issuance of incentive \nstock options (“ISOs”), nonqualified stock options (“NSOs”), SARs, restricted stock, RSUs, performance-based awards, and other \nawards (that are based in whole or in part by reference to our common stock).  \nThe number of shares of our common stock available for issuance under the 2019 Plan automatically increases on January 1 \nof each year, for a period of not more than ten years, comm encing on January 1, 2020 and ending on (and including) January 1, \n2029 by the lesser of (a) 5% of the tota l number of the shares of common stock out standing on December 31 of the immediately \npreceding calendar year, and (b) such number of shares determined  by our board of directors. Purs uant to the automatic increase  \nfeature of the 2019 Plan, our board of directors approved an increase of 105 million shares reserved for issuance effective January \n1, 2025, for a total of 545 million shares reserved.  \nStock Option and SAR Activity \nA summary of stock option and SAR activity for the year ended December 31, 2024 is as follows (in millions, except share \namounts which are reflected in thousands, per share amounts, and years): \n  \nSARs \nOutstanding \nNumber of \nSARs  \nOptions \nOutstanding \nNumber of \nShares  \nWeighted-\nAverage \nExercise Price \nPer Share  \nWeighted-\nAverage \nRemaining \nContractual \nLife (in years)  \nAggregate \nIntrinsic Value \nAs of December 31, 2023   123    12,641   $ 20.03   2.79  $ 535  \nGranted   —    3,009   $ 62.72      \nExercised   (90)    (7,909)   $ 16.90      \nCanceled and forfeited   —    (543)   $ 32.19      \nAs of December 31, 2024   33    7,198   $ 40.16   4.90  $ 153  \nExercisable as of December 31, 2024   33    3,484   $ 22.03   3.16  $ 135  \nThe total intrinsic value of stock options and SARs exercised for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, was \n$101 million, $319 million, and $433 million respectively. \nRSU Activity \nThe following table summarizes the activity related to our RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2024 (in thousands, except \nper share amounts): \n  Number of Shares  \nWeighted-Average \n Grant-Date Fair \n Value per Share \nUnvested and outstanding as of December 31, 2023   90,827   $ 34.49  \nGranted   28,750   $ 74.87  \nVested   (43,285)   $ 38.76  \nCanceled and forfeited   (10,090)   $ 40.89  \nUnvested and outstanding as of December 31, 2024   66,202   $ 48.49  ",

Vesting \nof this stock may be dependent on a combination of service and performance conditions that become satisfied upon the \noccurrence of a qualifying event. We have the right to repurchase shares for which the vesting conditions are not satisfied. Du ring \n2024, activity related to Uber’s restricted common stock was not material.\n \nStock-Based Compensation Expense \nStock-based compensation expense is allocated based on the cost center to which the award holder belongs.

Incremental stock-based compensation cost in relation to the \nmodification of stock-based awards was not material for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024. \nAs of December 31, 2024, there was $3.1 billion of unamortized co mpensation costs related to  all unvested awards. The \nunamortized compensation costs are expected to be recognized  over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.58 years. \nStock-based compensation expense capitalized as internally deve loped software costs were not material for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024. \nOur income tax benefits recognized in the consolidated statements of operations from stock-based compensation \narrangements were not material while we were under full valua tion allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets during the years \nended December 31, 2022 and 2023. With the release of the valuation allowance associated with our U.S. federal and certain stat e \ndeferred tax assets in 2024, income tax benefits recognized in  the consolidated statement of operations from stock-based \ncompensation expense were $381 million during the year ended December 31, 2024. \nDuring 2022, 2023 and 2024, warrants vested to non-employee se rvice providers and others were not material and no \nwarrants were granted. \nThe weighted-average grant-date fair values of stock options and SARs granted to employees in the years ended December \n31, 2022, 2023 and 2024 were $13.58, $16.63 and $25.97 per share, respectively. During 2022, 2023 and 2024, stock options and \nSARs granted were not material. \n \nPerformance awards with market-based targets granted in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024 were not \nmaterial. \n2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan \nThe number of shares of Uber common stock available for issuance under the ESPP automatically increases on January 1 of \neach year, beginning in 2020 and c ontinuing through 2029, by the less er of (a) 1.0% of the tota l number of shares of common \nstock outstanding on December 31 of the immediately preceding calendar year, and (b) 25,000,000 shares. However, our board of \ndirectors or compensation committee may reduce the amount of the increase in any part icular year. Pursuant to the automatic \nincrease feature of the ESPP, effective January 1, 2025, a total of  118 million shares of common stock are reserved for issuanc e \nunder the ESPP. \nThe stock-based compensation expense recognized for the ESPP was not material during the years ended December 31, 2022, \n2023 and 2024. During the year e nded December 31, 2024, we  purchased 4 million shares of co mmon stock under the ESPP at a \nweighted-average price of $39.95 per share. As of December 31, 2024, tota l unrecognized compensation co st related to the ESPP \nwas $31 million, which will be amortized over a period of 0.66 years. \nShare Repurchase Authorization ",
          " \n113 \nIn February 2024, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $7.0 billion in shar es of our outstanding common \nstock (the “Share Repurchase Program”). The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases are determined by the \ndiscretion of management, depending on mark et conditions and other factors. Repurch ases may be made through open market \npurchases and accelerated share repurchases. The exact number of shares to be repurchased by us, if any, is not guaranteed. \nDepending on market conditions and other factors, these repurchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or periodically \nwithout prior notice. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased and subsequently retired 17.8 million shares of common stock for \n$1.2 billion, excluding broker commissions and fees. As of December 31, 2024, we had $5.8 billion available to repurchase shares \npursuant to the Share Repurchase Program. \nIn January 2025, we announced that we entered into an acc elerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreement with a large \nfinancial institution to repurch ase $1.5 billion of our outstandi ng common stock as part of our  previously announced Share \nRepurchase Program. The transactions under the ASR agreement were completed during the first quarter of 2025. \nThe Inflation Reduction Act imposed a nondeductible 1% excise tax on the net value of certain stock repurchases. During the \nyear ended December 31, 2024, the excise tax on net share repurchases was not material. \n ",

In making that assessment, we consider \nboth positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realiz ation of the deferred tax assets to determine, based on the weight \nof all available evidence, whether it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.  \nAs of December 31, 2024, we demonstrated  sustained profitability in the U.S. base d on U.S. pre-tax book income adjusted for \npermanent book-to-tax differences. Further, given our taxable income position for the annual period ended on December 31, 2024, we \nutilized more attributes than we generated,  which reduces our U.S. federal and state net deferred tax assets. This information is both \nobjective and verifiable; thereby, representing strong positive evidence that carries significant weight.  \nBased on all available positive and negativ e evidence, including the objective and ve rifiable positive evidence as described ab ove \nand anticipated future earnings, we concluded it is more-likely-than-not that a majority of our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets \nwill be realizable. We continue to maintain  a valuation allowance against the California R&D credits, as we believe it is not m ore-\nlikely-than-not to be realized, as we expect R&D tax credit generation to exceed our ability to use these credits in future periods. \nFurthermore, based on available evidence, we believe it is more-l ikely-than-not that the Netherla nds’ net deferred tax assets will \nnot be fully realizable. We will continue to maintain a valuation allowance against th ese net deferred tax assets. We regularly  review \nthe deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected ti ming of \nthe reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies by jurisdiction. \nBased on our assessment of current income a nd anticipated future earnings , there is a reasonable possibility that we will have \nsufficient evidence to release a significant portion of the valua tion allowance in the Netherlands within the next 12 months. H owever, \nour judgment regarding future earnings and the exact timing and am ount of any valuation allowance release are subject to change  due \nto many factors, including future market conditions and the abili ty to successfully execute our business plans and/or tax plann ing ",
          " \n116 \nstrategies. Release of the valuation allowance would result in th e recognition of net deferred tax assets on our consolidated b alance \nsheet and would result in an income tax benefit in the period the release is recorded. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we had U.S. federal NOL carryforwar ds of $176 million that begin to  expire in 2031 and $8.2 billion \nthat have an unlimited carryover period. As  of December 31, 2024, we had U.S. stat e NOL carryforwards of $7.5 billion that star ted \nexpiring in 2024 and $1.6 billion th at have an unlimited carryove r period. As of December 31, 2024, we had foreign NOL \ncarryforwards of $759 million that begin to expire in 2024 and $19.2 billion that have an unlimited carryover period. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we ha d U.S. federal research tax cred it carryforwards of $1.2 billion th at begin to expire in 2028. We  \nhad U.S. state research tax credit carryforwards of $798 million that have an unlimited carryover period. \n In the event we experience an ownership change within the me aning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”), our \nability to utilize net operating losses, tax credits and other tax attributes may be limited. The mo st recent analysis of our h istorical \nownership changes was completed through December 31, 2024. Based on the analysis, we do not anticipate a current limitation on the \ntax attributes. \nThe following table reflects changes in gross unrecognized tax benefits (in millions): \n  Year Ended December 31, \n  2022  2023  2024 \nUnrecognized tax benefits at beginning of year  $ 2,657   $ 3,513   $ 3,345  \nGross increases - current year tax positions   814    177    201  \nGross increases - prior year tax positions (1)   93    42    1,437  \nGross decreases - prior year tax positions   (51)    (315)    (37)  \nGross decreases - settlements with tax authorities   —    —    (6)  \nGross decreases - lapse of statute of limitations   —    (72)    (3)  \nUnrecognized tax benefits at end of year  $ 3,513   $ 3,345   $ 4,937  \n(1) In 2024, new information became available that required a remeasurement of a prio r year transfer pricing tax position \nresulting in an overall reduction in our net deferred tax assets  of $1.2 billion, which is full y offset by a change in the \nvaluation allowance. This is reflected in the increases to prior year uncertain tax positions above. \n As of December 31, 2024, approximately $421 million of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact the effective tax \nrate. The remaining $4.5 billion of the unrecognized tax benefits would not impact the effective tax rate due to the valuation allowance \nagainst certain deferred tax assets.  \nWe recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecogni zed tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in the \nconsolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the amount of interest and penalties accrued was $17 \nmillion and $17 million, respectively.\n \n Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to \nestimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. An estimate of changes to \nunrecognized tax benefits recorded as of December 31, 2024 , that are reasonably possible to o ccur within the next 12 months can not \nbe made. \nWe are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are also under various state and other foreign \nincome tax examinations. We believe that adequate amounts have b een reserved in these jurisdictions. To the extent we have tax \nattribute carryforwards, the tax years in which the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the feder al, state \nor foreign tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period. \nAs of December 31, 2024, the open tax years for our major tax jurisdictions are as follows: \nJurisdiction  Tax Years \nU.S. Federal  2011 - 2024 \nU.S. States  2008 - 2024 \nAustralia  2019 - 2024 \nNetherlands  2019 - 2024 \nUnited Kingdom  2022 - 2024 \nAs of December 31, 2024, the am ount of unrecognized deferred ta x liability on the undistributed earnings from certain foreign \nsubsidiaries that we intend to indefinitely reinvest is not material. \nNote 12 – Net Income (Loss) Per Share ",

Mob ility also includes activity related to our financial \npartnerships products and advertising. \nDelivery \n \nDelivery offerings allow consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-\nup at the restaurant or have the meal delivered. In certain markets, Delivery provides offerings for grocery, \nalcohol, and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods. We refer to the grocery, alcohol, \nconvenience and retail categories collectively as Grocery & Retail. Delivery also includes advertising. \nFreight  Freight connects Carriers with Shippers on our platform , and gives Carriers upfront, transparent pricing and \nthe ability to book a shipment. Freight also includes tr ansportation management and other logistics services \nofferings. \nFor information about how our reportable segments derive revenue, as well as revenue grouped by offerings and geographical \nregion, refer to Note 2 – Revenue. \nOur segment operating performance measure is segment Adjusted EBITDA. The CODM uses segment Adjusted EBITDA to \nevaluate segment operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions. The CODM does not evaluate \noperating segments using asset information and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by segment. Segment Adjusted \nEBITDA excludes non-cash items or items that management does not believe are reflective of our ongoing core operations (as shown \nin the table below). \nThe following table provides information about our segments and a reconciliation to income (loss) before income taxes and \nincome (loss) from equity method investments (in millions): ",

As of \nDecember 31, 2023 and 2024, we had record ed aggregate liabilities of  $1.0 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, of which \n$336 million and $221 million, respectively, re late to non-income tax matters in accr ued and other curren t liabilities on the \nconsolidated balance sheets for all of our legal, regulatory and non-income tax matters that were probable and reasonably estimable. \nWe are currently party to various legal and regulatory matters th at have arisen in the normal course of business and include, \namong others, alleged independent contract or misclassification claims , Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) claims, alleged \nbackground check violations, prici ng and advertising claims, unfair competition cl aims, intellectual property claims, employmen t \ndiscrimination and other employmen t-related claims, Americans with  Disabilities Act (“ADA”) clai ms, data and privacy claims, \nsecurities claims, antitrust claims, challenges to regulations, and other matters. We have ex isting litigation, including class  actions, \nPrivate Attorney General Act lawsuits, arbitration claims, and governmental administrative a nd audit proceedings, asserting cla ims by \nor on behalf of Drivers that Drivers are mi sclassified as independent contractors. In  connection with the enactment of Californ ia State \nAssembly Bill 5 (“AB5”), we have received and expect to continue  to receive - in California and in other jurisdictions - an inc reased \nnumber of misclassification claims. With respect to our outstanding legal and regulatory matters, based on our current knowledg e, we \nbelieve that the ultimate amount or range of  reasonably possible loss will not, either i ndividually or in the aggregate, have a material \nadverse effect on our business, financial position, results of opera tions, or cash flows. The outco me of such legal matters is inherently \nunpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of \nmanagement's expectations, our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. \nDriver Classification \nCalifornia Attorney General Lawsuit \nIn January 2020, AB5 went into effect. AB5 codifies a test to  determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. \nThe test is referred to as the “ABC” test, and was originally handed down by the California Supr eme Court in Dynamex Operations v. \nSuperior Court in 2018. Under the ABC test , workers performing services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the  \nhiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring entity ’s control, (B) performs work that is outside the \nusual course of the hiring entity’s business, and (C) customarily engages in the indepe ndent trade, work or type of business pe rformed \nfor the hiring entity. \nOn May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorn eys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San \nDiego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc. (“Lyft”). The complaint alleges drivers ar e \nmisclassified, and seeks an injunction a nd monetary damages related to the allege d competitive advantage caused by the alleged \nmisclassification of drivers. \nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order, prohibiting us from classi fying drivers as independent \ncontractors and from violating various wage and hour laws. The injunction was stayed pending appeal. On October 22, 2020, the \nCourt of Appeal affirmed the lower court’s ruling, and we filed a petition for review of the deci sion with the California Supre me \nCourt. The petition was based upon the passage of Proposition 22 by California voters in November 2020, and requested that the Court \nof Appeal opinion be vacated because AB5’s application to Uber was superseded by Proposition 22. \nProposition 22 was a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers th at use platforms like ours to qualify as \nindependent workers. As a result of the passage of Proposition 22, Drivers are able to maintain their status as independent con tractors \nunder California law, and we a nd our competitors are required to comply with the provisions  of Proposition 22.  Proposition 22 w\nent \ninto effect on December 16, 2020. \nThe California Supreme Court declined the petition for review on February 10, 2021. The lawsuit wa s returned to the trial court  \nfollowing the appellate proceedings on February 22, 2021. On April 12, 2021, the California Attorney General, Uber and Lyft fil ed a \nstipulation to dissolve the preliminary in junction with the trial court. On April 16,  2021, the trial court signed an order gra nting the \nstipulation. Although the preliminary inj unction has been dissolved, the lawsuit remains ongoing relating to claims by the Cali fornia \nAttorney General for periods prior to enactment of Proposition 22. The parties pe titioned to stay this matter pending coordination with \nother California employment related matters, which was granted a nd a coordination judge was assigned. The case had been stayed ",

On July 2, 2024, the Superior \nCourt lifted the stay. We intend to continue to vigorously de fend ourselves. The ultimate resolu tion of these matters is uncert ain and \nthe amount accrued is recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. \nMassachusetts Attorney General Lawsuit \nOn July 9, 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney  General filed a complaint in Suffolk Coun ty Superior Court against Uber and Lyft. \nThe complaint alleges Drivers are employees, and are entitled to protections under the wage and labor laws. On June 27, 2024, t he \nparties reached an agreement to resolve the matter, and the case was dismissed the same day. In October 2024, we paid into a \nsettlement fund and resolved the matter. \nSwiss Social Security Rulings \nSeveral Swiss administrative bodies have issued  decisions in which they classify Driver s or Couriers as employees of Uber for \nsocial security or labor purposes. We are challenging each of them before the Social Security and Administrative Tribunals. \nOn March 21, 2023, the Federal Tribunal ruled that Drivers who have used the Uber App in 2014 qualify as employees for social \nsecurity purposes. The litigations with regards to the so cial security contributions are still pending for years 2014 to 2021. In October \n2024, the Social Security authority decided that the changes to our 2023 model are not sufficient to classify drivers as indepe ndent \ncontractors. We have filed an appeal against this decision. \nOn June 3, 2022, the Federal Tribunal issued two rulings by wh ich both Drivers and Couriers in the Canton of Geneva are \nclassified as employees of Uber B.V ., Uber Portier B.V . and Uber Switzerland GmbH. Following the ruling of the Federal Tribunal  on \nEats, the Social Security authorities claimed the payment of social security contributions since the launch of Uber Eats. We re ached a \nsettlement with the Canton of Geneva on Mobility with regards to social security implications. \nThe ultimate resolution of the matt ers before the social security authorities is uncertain and the amount accrued for those mat ters \nis recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. \nOther Driver Classification Matters \nAdditionally, we have received other lawsuits and governmental inquiries in other jurisdictions , and anticipate future claims, \nlawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, and gove rnment investigations and audits challenging our classificat ion of \nDrivers as independent contractors and not employees. We believe that our current and historical approach to classification is \nsupported by the law and intend to continue to defend ourselves vi gorously in these matters. However, the results of litigation  and \narbitration are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to these claims, individually or in the aggregate, could  have a \nmaterial impact on our business, financia l condition, results of operations and cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigati on and \narbitration of these matters can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the \naggregate, diversion of management resources and other factors. \nState Unemployment Taxes \nNew Jersey Department of Labor \nIn 2018, the New Jersey Department of Labor (“NJDOL”) ope ned an audit reviewing whether Drivers were independent \ncontractors or employees for purposes of  determining whether unemployment insura nce regulations apply from 2014 through 2018. \nThe NJDOL made an assessment on November 12, 2019, against both Rasier and Uber. Both assessments were calculated through \nNovember 15, 2019, but only calculated the alleged contributions, penalties, and interests owed from 2014 through 2018. The NJD OL \nhas provided several assessments from February through October 2021.  We have submitted payment for the principal revised amount  \nof the assessment and have since reached agreement on and paid the remaining amounts allegedly owed from 2014 through 2018.  \nThe NJ DOL has initiated an audit for th e period of 2019 through the second quarter  of 2023. The ultimate resolution of the \nmatter is uncertain and the amount accrued for those matters is record ed within accrued and othe r current liab ilities on the \nconsolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. \nCalifornia Employment Development Department \nIn 2014, the California employment development department (“CA  EDD”) opened an audit to review whether drivers should be \ntreated as employees or independent contra ctors. The department issued an assessment in 2016 for the periods of 2013 - 2015 and  we \nhave since reached an agreement with the CA EDD for this period. In 2022, we received requests for information related to an au dit of \na subsequent period, which covers the fourth  quarter of 2017 through the fourth quarter of 2020. We have also received an audit  for \nthe years 2018 - 2020 covering courie rs who used the Postmates plat form and received an assessment in June 2023. We are in the \nprocess of appealing the assessment. The ultimate re solution of the matter is  uncertain and the amount accrued for those matter s is \nrecorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. \nOther Matters ",
          " \n123 \nIPO Securities Litigation \nBeginning in September 2019, putative class actions were filed in California state and federal courts against us, our directors , \ncertain of our officers, and the underwriters named in our IPO re gistration statement, alleging viol ations of securities laws i n \nconnection with our May 2019 IPO. Following dismissal of certain ma tters, the remaining actions we re consolidated in the Northe rn \nDistrict of California, which granted Plai ntiffs’ motion for class certification in July 2022. On April 24, 2024, the parties i nformed the \ncourt that they were negotiating a settlement  agreement, and the court stayed the litig ation. On July 19, 2024, the parties exe cuted and \npublicly filed a settlement agreement. On August 9, 2024, the c ourt granted preliminary approval of the settlement. On December  4, \n2024, the court granted final approval and the matter was resolved . The settlement has been fully paid. Separately, a sharehold er filed \na follow-on derivative action on behalf of the Company, against the same officers and directors, and that matter has been staye d since \nFebruary 2021, with a status conference scheduled for March 13, 2025. \nNon-Income Tax Matters \nWe recorded an estim ated liability for cont ingencies related to non-income tax matt ers and are under aud it by various domestic \nand foreign tax authorities with regard to such matters.  \nThe subject matter of these contingent liabilities and non-incom e tax audits primarily arise from the characterization for tax \npurposes of the transactions on the platform, as well as the application of certain employee benefits and employment and income taxes \nto our Drivers and Couriers. In jurisdictions with disputes conn ected to transactions on the platform, disputes involve the applicability \nof transactional taxes (such as sales tax, V AT, GST and similar taxes) or gross receipts taxes. In jurisdictions with disputes connected \nto employment or income taxes, disputes involve the applicabil ity of withholding taxes related to employment taxes or back-up \nincome tax withholding on payments made to Drivers, Couriers, and Merchants. \nOur estimated liability is inherently subjective due to the complexity and uncertainty of these matters and the judicial proces ses in \ncertain jurisdictions; therefore, the final outcome could be materially different from the estimated liability recorded. \nUnited Kingdom \nAs of March 14, 2022, we modified our operating model in the UK, such that as of that date Uber UK is a merchant of \ntransportation and is required to remit V AT. Uber UK is remitt ing V AT under the Value Added (Tour Operators) Order 1987 (“V AT \nOrder 1987”), which allows for V AT remittance on a calculated margin, rather than on Gross Bookings.  \nAs of December 31, 2024, we have receive d multiple assessments from the HMRC dispu ting our application of V AT Order 1987 \nfor the period of March 2022 to June 2024, totaling appr oximately $1.6 billion (£1.3 billion) for unpaid V AT. Uber paid the \nassessments in order to proceed with the appeal process. The payments do not represent our acceptance of the assessments.\n \nThe payments made in 2023 and 2024 are record ed as a receivable in other assets on our  consolidated balance sheet because we \nbelieve that we will be successful in our appeal, upon which, the full amount of our paym ents will be returned to us with interest upon \ncompletion of the appeals process. We expect to receive additiona l assessments related to this matter and will be required to p ay the \nassessments in order to continue with the appeals process. Any payments are expected to decrease operating cash flow and have n o \nimpact on our results of operations. We plan to vigorously defe nd our application of the V AT Order 1987 and are waiting to obta in \nhearing dates from the Tax Tribunal. \nBrazil \nIn May 2023, we received an assessment for 2019 and 2020 Driver  social security contributions from the Brazilian Federal \nRevenue Bureau (“FRB”). We are contesting the assessment and we f iled our administrative appeal with the FRB in June 2023. In \nApril 2024, we received a positive decision from the FRB. This decision was appealed, and another positive decision to Uber was  \nissued by the Court of Appeals in September 2024, maintaining th e first instance deci sion. If the tax aut horities in Brazil app eal this \nsecond positive decision, Uber will continue to defend its position. \nIn December 2024, due to the abse nce of an appeal from the Na tional Treasury, a formal docum ent was issued confirming the \nclosure of the case in the Company’s favor. As a result, the case has been archived and closed.  ",
          " \n124 \nOther Legal and Regulatory Matters \nWe have been or are currently subject to various government inquiries and investigations surrounding the legality of certain of our \nbusiness practices, compliance w ith antitrust, anti-bribery and anti-corruption la ws (including the Foreign Corrupt Practices A ct) and \nother global regulatory requirements, labor laws, securities laws, data protection and privacy laws, consumer protection laws, \nenvironmental laws, and the infringement of certain intellectual property rights. We are investigating many of these matters an d are \nimplementing a number of recommendations to our managerial, opera tional and compliance practices, as well as strengthening our \noverall governance structure. In many cases, we are unable to pr edict the outcomes and implications of these inquiries and \ninvestigations on our business which could be time consuming, cos tly to investigate and require significant management attentio n. \nFurthermore, the outcome of these inquiries  and investigations could negatively impact  our business, reputation, financial cond ition \nand operating results, including possible fines and penalties and requiring changes to operational activities and procedures. \nWe have been and expect to continue to be subject to personal  injury claims for compensation based on traffic accidents, deaths , \ninjuries, or other incidents that are caused by Drivers, consumers,  or third parties while using our  platform, or even when Dri vers, \nconsumers, or third parties are not activel y using our platform. Various plaintiffs ha ve also coordinated and may in the future  attempt \nto coordinate individual injury claims in  various jurisdictions. We use a combinati on of third-party insurance and self-insuran ce \nmechanisms to provide for personal injury risks. Our insurance re serves include unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses rela ted to \nthese claims. \nIndemnifications \nIn the ordinary course of business, we often include standard indemnification provisions in our arrangements with third parties . \nPursuant to these provisions, we may be oblig ated to indemnify such parties for losses or claims suffered or incurred in connec tion \nwith their activities or non-complia nce with certain representations  and warranties made by us. In  addition, we have entered in to \nindemnification agreements with our officers, directors, and certain current and former employees, and our certificate of incor poration \nand bylaws contain certain indemnification obligations. It is not possible to dete rmine the maximum potential loss under these \nindemnification provisions / obligations because of the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular situation. \nNote 15 – Variable Interest Entities \nConsolidated VIEs \nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary because \nwe have the power to direct the activities that most significan tly impact the economic performance of these VIEs. As a result, we \nconsolidate the assets and liabilities of these consolidated VIEs. \nTotal assets included on the consolidated balance sheets for our consolidated  VIEs as of December 31, 2023 and 2024 were $3.5 \nbillion and $3.4 billion, respectively. Total li abilities included on the c onsolidated balance sheets for these VIEs as of Dece mber 31, \n2023 and 2024 were $755 million and $724 million, respectively. \nUber Freight Holding Corporation \nIn July 2018, we created a new majority-owned subsidiary, Uber  Freight Holding Corporation (“Freight Holding”). The purpose \nof Freight Holding is to perform the business activities of th e Freight operating segment. The Freight Holding stock held by us  was \ndetermined to be a variable interest. \nIn October 2020, Freight Holding entered into a Series A pref erred stock purchase agreement (“ 2020 Freight Series A Preferred \nStock Purchase Agreement”) with an outside investor (“2020 Freight Series A Investor”) to sell shares of Series A Preferred Sto ck \n(“Freight Series A”). \nIn July 2021, we entered into a Freight Series A preferred stock purchase agreement and sold shares of Freight Series A to The \nPublic Investment Fund, which is an investor in Uber.  \nIn November 2021, Freight Holding entered into a series A- 1 stock purchase agreement (“202 1 Series A-1 Pr eferred Stock \nPurchase Agreement”) with outside investors (“Freight Series A-1 Investors”) to sell shares of Series A-1 convertible preferred  stock \nof Freight Holding (“Freight Series A-1”). Neither the Freight Series A nor Freight Series A-1 investments changed the conclusion that \nFreight Holding is a consolidated  VIE. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, we continue to own the majority of the issued and \noutstanding capital stock of Freight Holdi ng and report a non-controlling interest as further described in Note 16 – Non-Contro lling \nInterests. \nIn February 2023, Freight Holding entered into a $300 million se nior secured asset-based revolvi ng credit facility guaranteed b y \nthe assets of Freight Holding. As of December 31, 2023, there was no balance outstanding on Freight Holding’s revolving credit \nfacility. In November 2024, Freight Holding terminated the revolving credit facility. ",
          " \n125 \nUnconsolidated VIEs \nWe do not consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest but are not the primary beneficiary because we lack the power to \ndirect the activities that most significantly impact the entiti es’ economic performance. We are exposed to these unconsolidated  VIEs’ \neconomic risks and rewards through the related carrying amount of assets and liabilities and any financial guarantees, which re present \nvariable interests. Our carrying amounts of both assets and liabilities recognized on the conso lidated balance sheets related t o \nunconsolidated VIEs noted belo w were $575 million and $577 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. As of \nDecember 31, 2023 and 2024, our maximu m exposure to loss was $686 million and $691 million, respectively. Our maximum \nexposure to loss includes the carrying amounts of assets and liabi lities recognized on our consolidated balance sheet related t o the \nunconsolidated VIEs noted below as well as an immaterial financial guarantee. \nLime \nLime is incorporated in Delaware for the purpose of owning a nd operating a fleet of dockless e-bikes and e-scooters for short-\nterm access use by consumers for personal transportation. Our owne rship in Lime is comprised of  Lime Common Stock, Lime 1-C \nPreferred Stock, Lime 1-C Prefer red Stock Warrants, and the Lime Convertible Note  (collectively, the “2020 Lime Investments”). We \nare exposed to Lime’s economic risks and rewards through the re lated carrying amount of assets and liabilities and any financia l \nguarantees, which represent variable interests. \nMoove \nOn February 12, 2021 (the “Moove Closing Date”), we entered into and completed a series of agreements with Garment \nInvestments S.L. dba Moove (“Moove”), a vehicle fleet operator in Spain, including (i) an equity investment, through preferred shares, \nin which Uber acquired a 30% minority interest in Moove from its current shareholders at closing and up to approximately $185 \nmillion contingent on future performance of Moove and certain other conditions through the eighth anniversary of the agreement, (ii) a \nterm loan of $213 million to Moove, due Fe bruary 2026, and (iii) a co mmercial partnershi p agreement. Also included in the \nagreements is an option for us to purchase common stock of Moove  at fair value, beginning two y ears after the Moove Closing Dat e. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we have not exercised this option. After this series of agreements, Moove is considered a related party. \nIn February 2023, we entered into a settlement and amendment agreement (“Moove Settlement”) with Moove, a related party, to \nsettle certain contingent considerations agreements. As a result of the Moove Settlement, we made an immaterial payment to Moov e. \nAs of December 31, 2023, the remaining contingent liability wa s recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on our \nconsolidated balance sheet and was not material. The contingent liability was paid in January 2024. \nOur equity investment in Moove, through preferred shares, is acc ounted for as an investment in non-marketable equity securities \nincluded in investments on our consolidated balance sheets. The term loan, of $288 million as of  December 31, 2024, is accounted for \nas a loan receivable, carried at amortized cost, and included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 3 – \nInvestments and Fair Value Measurement, Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Ba sis, for additio nal information \nregarding our non-marketable equity securities. \nNote 16 – Non-Controlling Interests \nWe have consolidated subsidiaries that have issued common stock and preferred stock or preferred units to third party investors, \nrepresenting non-controlling interests. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the carrying value of non-controlling interests represented \nby subsidiaries’ preferred units and preferred stock were $1.6 billion and $820 million, respectively. \nFreight Holding \nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2024, we owned 74% and 84%, respectively, of our subsidiary Freight Holding capital stock, or \n72% and 80%, respectively, on a fully-diluted basis. The minority  stockholders of Freight Holdi ng include, among others: (i) ho lders \nof Freight Holding’s Series A a nd A-1 Preferred Stock; (ii) holders of common e quity awards issued under the employee equity \nincentive plans; and (iii) current and former employees who hold fully vested shares.\n \nAs of December 31, 2023, a total number of 356.7 million shares of Freight Holding were reserved, of which 273.8 million shares \nwere available for grant and issuance. \nAs of December 31, 2024, a total number of 356.7 million shares of Freight Holding were reserved, of which 225.4 million shares \nwere available for grant and issuance. ",
          " \n126 \nCertain Holders of Common Stock of Freight Holding \nCertain minority common stockholders of our subsidiary Freight  Holding, including individuals  who hold shares obtained from \nthe exercise of vested stock options issued under Freight Hold ing’s 2018 employee equity incentive plan, have put rights to sel l \nincreasing percentages of their equity interests at fair value to  Freight Holding at specified pe riods of time ending in August  2025 \nthrough August 2027 that terminates upon the earliest of the cl osing of a liquidation transaction or an IPO of the subsidiary; provided, \nhowever, that former employees who hold shares will only have a one-time opportunity to  exercise their put right to sell 100% of their \nequity interests for a specified period of time ending in August 2025. Should the put rights be exercised, they can be satisfie d in either \ncash, Uber stock, or a combination of cash and Uber stock based upon our election. \nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the minority common stockholde rs ownership in Freight Holding is classified as a \nredeemable non-controlling interest, because it is redeemable on an event that is not solely in our control. In the third quarter of 2024, \nthe redeemable non-controlling interest related to these certain  minority common stockholders of  Freight Holding was deemed \nprobable of becoming redeemable and re-measured to its estimate d redemption value with an ad justment of $338 million. This \nredeemable non-controlling interest is re-measured to its estimated redemption value each reporting period. \nWe attribute the pro rata share of Freight Holding’s net income or loss available to holders of common stock to the redeemable \nnon-controlling interests generated from common shares of Freight  Holding based on th e outstanding owners hip of the minority \nshareholders of common shares during the period. \nFreight Series A Preferred Stock \nIn October 2020, Freight Holding entered into a 2020 Freight Seri es A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with a 2020 Freight \nSeries A Investor. Pursuant to the 2020 Frei ght Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Ag reement, the 2020 Freight Series A Investor  \nagreed to invest an aggregate of $500 m illion in Freight Holding, which occurred ove r two closings, subject to customary closin g \nconditions. \nIn October 2020, the initial closing occurred pursuant to the 2020 Freight Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement and 2020 \nFreight Series A Investor invested $250 million in exchange for 124.7 million shares of Freight Series A preferred stock. \nIn August 2022, the second closing occurred pursuant to the Frei ght Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement and the 2020 \nFreight Series A Investor invested an additional $250 million in exchange for 124.7 million shar es of Freight Series A preferred stock. \nPrior to their redemption in October 2024, the 2020 Freight Series A Investor was considered a related party to Freight Holding. \nWe do not attribute the pro rata share of the Freight Holding’s loss to the redeem able non-controlling inte rests in Series A \nPreferred shares of Freight Holding because these shares are entitled to a liquidation preference and therefore do not particip ate in \nlosses that would cause their interest to be below the liquida tion preference. Upon liquidation, these Freight Series A preferr ed stock \nare entitled to the greater of either (i) a 1.5x liquidation pref erence on their initial investment, as well as 6% continuously  \ncompounding cumulative dividends that will be  paid before any distribution to common shar eholders or (ii) the fair value of the ir \ninvestment (the “Freight Series  A Liquidation Preference”). The di vidend, along with any attribut ed prorated share of Freight \nHolding’s net income (if ap plicable), are included in  net income (loss) attr ibutable to non-controlling interests, net of tax i n our \nconsolidated statements of operations. \nOn October 6, 2023, the 2020 Freight Series A Investor exercised their right to require that either Freight Holding conduct an IPO \nor we redeem them at the Freight Series A Liquidation Preference, described above. \nAs of December 31, 2023, the Frei ght Series A preferred st ock held by the 2020 Fr eight Series A Investor  is classified as a \nredeemable non-controlling in terest, because it is redeemable on an event that is not solely in  our control. Given the 2020 Fre ight \nSeries A Investor exercised their right during the fourth quarter of 2023, this redeemable non-controlling interest was deemed probable \nof redemption. Based on the Freight Series A Liquidation Preference, this redeemable non-controlling interest was re-measured t o its \nfull estimated redemption value with an adjustment of $286 milli on. Upon the redemption date in October 2024, we repurchased th e \n2020 Freight Series A Investor’s Freight Series A preferred stock in cash for $851 million. \nIn July 2021, we entered into a Series A preferred stock purch ase agreement and sold shares of Freight Holding's Series A \nPreferred Stock to The Public Investment F und, which is an investor in Uber, representing 4% ownership interest on a fully dilu ted \nbasis at the time of the sale. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the Freight Series A preferred stock held by the Public Invest ment \nFund were classified as non-redeemable non-controlling interests as these shares of preferred stock are not subject to any mandatory \nredemption rights or redemption rights that are outside our control.  \nFreight Series A-1 Preferred Stock \nIn November 2021, Freight Holding entered into a 2021 Series A- 1 Preferred Stock Purchase Agr eement with Freight Series A-1 \nInvestors. Pursuant to the 2021 Series A-1 Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, the Frei ght Series A-1 Investors agreed to inves t an \naggregate of $550 million in Freight Holding in exchange for Freight Series A-1 preferred stock. \nFreight Series A-1 Investors have basic ri ghts and preferences which primarily incl ude: one vote per share; conversion rights t o \ncommon shares; 6% cumulative dividend pref erence and liquidation preference (a 1.0x liqui dation preference of original issuance  ",
          " \n127 \nprice plus cumulative unpaid dividends). Th e accruing dividends are compounding annually, and are only payable when dividends a re \ndeclared by Freight Holding’s Board. The dividend, along with any attributed prorated share of Freight Holding’s net income (if  \napplicable), are included in  net income (loss) attr ibutable to non-controlling interests, net of tax in  our consolidated statem ents of \noperations. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the Freight Series  A-1 preferred stock held by th e Freight Series A-1 Investors  were \nclassified as non-redeemable non-controlling interests as  these shares of preferred stock are not subject to any mandatory redemption \nrights or redemption rights that are outside our control. \nFreight Holding Supplier Financing Program \nFreight Holding utilizes a third-pa rty financial institution that allows our suppliers to be paid by the third-party financial \ninstitution earlier than the due date on the applicable invoice at a discounted price. In genera l, supplier invoices financed b y the third-\nparty financial institution are due for payment by Freight Holding within thirty days. \nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the liability related to Freight Holding’s supplier financing program are included within \naccounts payable on the consolidated balance sheets.
