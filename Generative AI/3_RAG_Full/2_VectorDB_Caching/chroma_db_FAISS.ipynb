    "# VectorDB\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector databases are optimized for semantic search. They use **ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbor)** algorithms, which trade a bit of accuracy for significantly faster performance compared to exact **KNN (k-Nearest Neighbors)**. ANN typically operates in *O(log N)* time, while KNN is *O(N)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### VectorDB vs RDBMS\n",
    "\n",
    "* **RDBMS** stores structured data (rows and columns) and relies on exact keyword matching.\n",
    "* **VectorDB** stores unstructured data (text, images, audio, video) as vector embeddings and enables similarity-based search.\n",
    "* VectorDBs are faster for semantic search and are critical in GenAI and **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indexing Techniques in VectorDB\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Flat**: Brute-force search.\n",
    "* **LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing)**: Groups vectors into hash buckets.\n",
    "* **IVF (Inverted File Index)**: Partitions vectors into clusters; **IVFPQ** further compresses each cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * *Note:* Borderline vectors may trigger search in nearby clusters.\n",
    "* **HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)**: Organizes vectors in a multi-layer graph for fast navigation across similar vectors."
