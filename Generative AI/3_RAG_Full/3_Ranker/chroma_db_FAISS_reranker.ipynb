    "# Rerankers\n",
    "\n",
    "Rerankers are models used to improve the relevance of search or retrieval results. After an initial retrieval (often using a vector database or keyword search), rerankers re-evaluate the top candidates to sort them more accurately based on the original query.\n",
    "\n",
    "They typically use **deep learning models**, especially **cross-encoders**, which consider the query and each candidate together for finer semantic matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rerankers vs Retrievers\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Retrievers** (e.g. in VectorDBs) quickly return a list of candidates based on similarity in embedding space.\n",
    "* **Rerankers** take the top-N retrieved results and **rescore them** based on deeper semantic alignment with the query.\n",
    "* While retrievers are fast and scalable, rerankers are **more accurate** but **computationally heavier**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Reranking Models\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cross-Encoders**: Models like `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` that take *(query, document)* pairs and return a relevance score.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * They consider full interaction between query and document.\n",
    "  * Typically used for reordering top-K results (e.g., top 100 to top 5).\n",
    "* **MonoT5 / MonoBERT**: Encoder-decoder models that classify each result as relevant or not, or score them.\n",
    "* **LLMs (e.g., GPT)**: Can act as rerankers via prompt-based ranking or chain-of-thought relevance scoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tradeoffs\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature       | Retriever (e.g. VectorDB) | Reranker                  |\n",
    "| ------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |\n",
    "| Speed         | Fast (sub-second)         | Slower (per item scoring) |\n",
    "| Accuracy      | Moderate                  | High                      |\n",
    "| Scalability   | High (millions of docs)   | Low (top-N only)          |\n",
    "| Contextuality | Limited                   | Deep semantic matching    |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use in RAG Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "Rerankers are widely used in **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** systems to ensure only the **most relevant passages** are sent to the generator (e.g., GPT). This improves generation quality and factual accuracy.\n"

(“Uber,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is\\nheadquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology,\\noperational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. Uber develops and operates proprietary\\ntechnology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (“platform(s)” or “Platform(s)”). Uber connects consumers\\n(“Rider(s)”) with independent providers of ride services (“Mobility Driver(s)”) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other\\nconsumers (“Eaters”) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, “Merchants”) with delivery service providers\\n(“Couriers”) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as “end-user(s)”\\nor “consumer(s).” Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as “Driver(s).” Uber also connects consumers with public\\ntransportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers\\n(“Shippers”) with carriers (“Carriers”) in the freight industry. The foundation of our platform is this network of Drivers, Couriers,\\nMerchants, Carriers as well as Riders, Eaters and Shippers (collectively “Platform Participant(s)”). We define Platform Earner(s) as\\nDrivers, Couriers and Merchants as well as Carriers. Uber is also developing technologies designed to provide new solutions to solve\\neveryday problems.\\nOur technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada, Latin America, Europe (excluding\\nRussia), the Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific (“APAC”, excluding China and Southeast Asia).\\nFoodpanda Taiwan\\nIn May 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement with Delivery Hero SE (“Delivery Hero”) to acquire 100% ownership\\ninterest in Delivery Hero’s Foodpanda delivery business in Taiwan (“Foodpanda Taiwan”) for approximately $950 million in cash, on\\na cash and debt free basis, subject to certain adjustments. In January 2025, the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission issued a decision\\nprohibiting the transaction. If we do not appeal the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission’s decision, we expect to pay a termination fee\\nduring the first half of 2025.

Also included is the cost of customer support, Driver background checks and the allocation of certain corporate\\ncosts.\\nWe would expect operations and support expenses to vary from period to period on an absolute dollar basis, but decrease as a\\npercentage of revenue as we become more efficient in supporting platform users.\\nSales and Marketing\\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of advertising costs, product marketing costs, consumer discounts, promotions,\\ncredits and refunds provided to end-users who are not customers, compensation costs, including stock-based compensation to sales\\nand marketing employees, and the allocation of certain corporate costs. We expense advertising and other promotional expenditures as\\nincurred.\\nWe would expect sales and marketing expenses to vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue due to timing of\\nmarketing campaigns.\\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we implemented a business model change in certain major markets resulting in end-\\nusers becoming our customers.

Expenses also include ongoing improvements to, and maintenance of, existing\\nproducts and services, and allocation of certain corporate costs.

    "\n",
    "### ✅ If you need **speed** (real-time apps, chatbots):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use: `MiniLM-L6-v2`, `TinyBERT-L2-v2`\n",
    "* Why: They balance speed and relevance well for interactive systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ If you need **accuracy** (offline batch reranking, fact-sensitive RAG):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use: `MiniLM-L12-v2`, `monoT5-base`, or `GPT-based reranking`\n",
    "* Why: These give better semantic alignment, especially for nuanced queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ If you support **multiple languages**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use: `rerank-multilingual-MiniLM`\n",
    "* Why: Trained on multilingual data; good for cross-language search.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ If you're constrained on **resources**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use: `TinyBERT`, `MiniLM-L6`\n",
    "* Why: Small and efficient, suitable for edge devices or large-scale deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ If you want **explainable reranking** (e.g., CoT or score reasoning):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use: GPT or Claude, via prompt engineering\n",
    "* Why: LLMs can rank based on reasoning steps (e.g., “this passage better answers the question because…”)."
